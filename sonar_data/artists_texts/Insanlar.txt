Insanlar
Turkish hypnosis
Committed wax-collector Baris K got his grounding in hip hop breaks from over a decade of producing his own weekly shows on Istanbul’s Dinamo FM and Açık Radyo. Inspired by revolutionary Turkish rock icon Baris Manco, he then turned his crate-digging powers closer to home, and uncovered a treasure trove of spaced-out psych rock and hashish-stained disco. With supersized bass lines and popping guitars, held together with spacey echoes and Turkish woodwinds, Baris has cornered a dancefloor sound that’s all his own. Baris blurs the boundaries even further with his improvised folk band Insanlar, a collaboration with sax player Cem Yildiz and a rotating group of guest artists. The band’s first single “Kime Ne” has been causing dancefloor goosebumps with its mixture of hypnotic tones and slow-build rhythms, and inaugurated Baris’ own Aboov Plak imprint in 2013. Ricardo Villalobos supplied a memorable edit of the tune for Honest Jon’s last year.
