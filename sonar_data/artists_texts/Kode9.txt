Kode9
HyperDJ
Even before creating the fundamental British electronic music label Hyperdub in 2004, Steve Goodman had taken his first artistic steps as Kode9, playing at some of the most emblematic clubs in South London (including the legendary FWD>). Since then he has continued to dj and is considered to be a true master of the art. His sets often journey through various hardcore continuum styles: jungle, dubstep, UK funky, garage, grime, and in more recent years adding a large helping of footwork, the genre which he has helped popularize throughout Europe through his sets as well as several Hyperdub releases. This year at Sónar he will provide two very different performances: firstly he will present "Nothing" live, with stage design by Lawrence Lek, returning for a DJ set on Friday 17th at Sónar by Night, providing the perfect sonic bridge between the concerts of Jean-Michel Jarre and James Blake.

Steve Goodman is perhaps the most important figure in the UK bass music scene: an extraordinary DJ; founder of the Hyperdub label (which has released, among many others: Hype Williams, Laurel Halo, Cooly G, King Midas Sound, Zomby, Dj Rashad and Darkstar); and a producer with an impressive discography including three LPs: "Memories of the Future" (2006), "Black Sun" (2011) (both with the late singer Spaceape) and "Nothing" released in 2015. He is also the author of the "Sonic Warfare", a book about the effect of noise in urban sound environments.
