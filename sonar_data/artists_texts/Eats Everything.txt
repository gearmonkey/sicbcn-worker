Eats Everything
Luscious dance music
Few artists have made such an impressive impact in the world of dance music as Dan Pearce, the man behind the Eats Everything alias. And few can claim to be as busy. The British DJ and producer has barely stopped working since the release of his classic “Entrance Song” in 2011, and has played across the globe alongside the leading DJs of his generation. His chosen weapons are no secret: elastic beats indebted to funk, dance floor house music in its many forms, and an expansive personality that can clearly be seen in all of his sets. If what you seek is non-stop dancing and abandoning your body to magical rhythms, Saturday at SonarClub with Eats Everything is an absolute must.

The Bristol based housemaster has for five consecutive years built an incredible reputation by obliterating all dance floors in his path and releasing a plethora of material that always carries his indelible mark. His discography includes songs released on several seminal labels (2020 Vision, Get Physical, Hypercolour, Futureboogie, Crosstown Rebels); a comprehensive and open-minded collection of edits; an already legendary Essential Mix for BBC Radio 1 entitled “Edits Everything”; remixes for Jamie Jones, Disclosure and Four Tet; collaborations and sets with Seth Troxler, Jackmaster, Claude Von Stroke; and typically powerful sets (always with a sense of humour) in which contemporary house is mixed seamlessly with garage, techno funk, bass music and even drum'n'bass.
