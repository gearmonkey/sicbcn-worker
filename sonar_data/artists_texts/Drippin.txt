Drippin
Icy beats
Erik Spanne, AKA Drippin, is a young beatmaker with a flair for unique and compelling takes on club music of all types –eerie, erogenous, and evocative. Based in Norway, he produces duly icy riddims, specializing in the kind of spacious and chilling pan-genre club thumpers of contemporaries like Nguzunguzu and Fatima Al Qadiri. In fact it was through Al Qadiri that the Norwegian producer first linked with J-Cush, whose Lit City Trax label released Drippin's ‘Silver Cloak’ EP in 2014. Drippin has also laced New York avant-rapper Le1f and Chicago bop duo Sicko Mobb with a few beats.
