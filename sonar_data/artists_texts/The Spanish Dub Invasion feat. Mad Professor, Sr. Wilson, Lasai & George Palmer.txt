The Spanish Dub Invasion feat. Mad Professor, Sr. Wilson, Lasai & George Palmer
Reggae-dub assault in SonarVillage﻿
Three of Spain’s chief representatives of reggae and dub -Sr. Wilson, Lasai and George Palmer- will join forces with the legendary Mad Professor (the original pioneer of British dub and roots and a leading figure on the international scene for more than three decades), in what will be an unprecedented high-flying project: The Spanish Dub Invasion. The Professor brings his immeasurable wisdom and deep bass chopses from the legendary Ariwa studios in London, where the three Spanish vocalists have travelled to deploy their repertoire of rhymes and melodies, each with their own characteristic flow. The project, now in its first steps, will perform their exciting show live at Sónar by Day, with a strong Jamaican heartbeat at its core and a sure-fire combination of euphoric reggae and hypnotic dub.

A direct disciple of Lee Perry and a key figure in British dub, Mad Professor's work has been instrumental in the transition from the genre’s classical precepts towards the digital domain. His long career is full of memorable records and productions, both as a solo artist and in numerous collaborations (and remixes) for artists like Massive Attack, Sly & Robbie, Sade, Horace Andy, Beastie Boys, The KLF and The Orb. For this new project the grand master is joined by three of Spain’s most prominent "singjays": Catalonia's Mr. Wilson, Madrid's Lasai and Basque Country's George Palmer. The three have already released several records and have more than respectable music backgrounds, through sound systems and collectives including Badalonians Sound, Dremen or Bomb Bass Hi Fi, among others.
