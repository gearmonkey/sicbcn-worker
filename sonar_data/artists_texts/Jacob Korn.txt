Jacob Korn
German touch
Alongside his actual profession on the interface of audio, visual and dance, Jacob Korn has also been producing electronic music for what seems like an eternity. Early on in his career, the 2007 Academy alum combined hip hop and techno with elements of jazz and weird electronics under the moniker of Granufunk. Under his given name, Korn is now focussing predominantly on classic but versatile techno and house. After releases on labels such as Running Back, Skylax or Permanent Vacation, Steffiâ€™s Dolly Label, and Dresden powerhouse Uncanny Valley, his name has become one of the most celebrated on the current German house circuit.
