Jean-Michel Jarre
The Godfather of Electronic Music
A pioneer and a titan of electronic music since his groundbreaking debut album Oxygene, the French producer, musician and composer Jean-Michel Jarre recently released his new project, “Electronica”, in two parts. Vol.1, “The Time Machine", was released at the end of 2015, with the collaboration of artists such as Vince Clarke, John Carpenter, Boys Noize, Robert "3D" Del Naja (de Massive Attack), Air, M83, Fuck Buttons and Laurie Anderson, among others. The following volume, named “The Heart Of Noise”, appeared this Spring and saw Jarre working with Pet Shop Boys, Gary Numan, Peaches, The Orb, Siriusmo, Julia Holter and even Edward Snowden. This two albums will form the core of his new highly anticipated live show, the world premiere of which will take place at Sonar by Night on Friday June 16th.

Jean-Michel Jarre’s successful career spans over four decades. Seminal albums “Oxygene” and “Equinoxe” are widely considered to be fundamental works in popular electronic music, a first reference in many households for the genre, and an inspiration for many of the next generation of tech savvy musicians and producers. Another of his great contributions to electronic music has been his visionary live shows, always imagined as sensory and technological experiences of colossal proportions, designed on city scale. Up to one million people attended shows in Paris and Houston and Jarre also performed in front of Guinness-World Breaking audience of 3.5 million live in Moscow. It can be said that over 30 years ago, Jarre was the first to invent and create the multimedia concert experience as we know it today, mapping buildings of cities around the world before anyone, lighting the skies with beams and pyrotechnics, offering his audience the ultimate, total immersion, sound and vision experience, which today is the ambition of every international festival.
