Toxe
Unique sister
Brought up in a creative milieu by artist parents, Toxe picked up most of her musical skills of her own accord, with a little help from her brother. Her tunes weld chattering drum beats with singed vocal loops and devouring treacle-thick sub-bass, never pausing for a second thought. Her debut EP was released on Stockholm label Staycore in 2015, and she spent much of that year playing parties across Sweden. In her spare time, she works on her own music videos, and is also a co-founder of Sister, a promotional online platform for female musicians in dance music.
