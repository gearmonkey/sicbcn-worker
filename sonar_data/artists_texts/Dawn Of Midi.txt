Dawn Of Midi
Electrifying minimalism
"It sounds like nothing else right now", said The Guardian in a recent review of this Brooklyn-based trio formed by Qasim Naqvi (drums), Aakaash Israni (bass) and Amino Belyamani (piano). This is certainly the case, as there are few bands that resemble them. Dawn Of Midi make contemporary instrumental and minimalist music with acoustic instruments, which sounds like cutting edge and experimental electronica. With this in mind they can perhaps be compared to bands like Elektroguzzi or Brandt Brauer Frick, although the final result is different, closer at times to Plastikman’s first forays into scientific techno or at other times the repetitive depth of Steve Reich. The trio debut in Barcelona for two concerts at Sónar 2016, one on Thursday 16 at the Auditori, and another on Friday 17 at SonarComplex (Sónar by Day).

The music of Dawn Of Midi is perfectly embodied by the album "Dysnomia", released originally in 2013 and recently reissued by Erased Tapes. On this album, the American trio replace improvisation with composition, shaping visceral, physical, complex and open sounds, increasingly influenced by structures and melodies from Morocco, India and Pakistan (the countries where these three instrumentalists can trace their origins). When playing live, their haunting and hypnotic effect is even greater, giving rise to a pure trancelike ceremony where we experience how each musician plays their instrument, far beyond long established conventional forms of music.
