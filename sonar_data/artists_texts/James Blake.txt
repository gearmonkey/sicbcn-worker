James Blake
New record, new show
After speculations about dates and titles, James Blake has dropped his third album, “The Colour In Anything”. The record -previously rumoured to be titled Radio Silence (the title of the opening track)- features two very special guest collaborators: Frank Ocean and Bon Iver's Justin Vernon. More high profile collaborations come in the form of infamous US producer Rick Rubin -who produced several tracks on the record- and Roald Dahl illustrator Sir Quentin Blake, who designed the artwork. Blake will perform his new songs at Sónar By Night live, an area in which the London musician feels especially at home, and where his stunning music becomes even more powerful. 

Artists like Blake are a rare occurrence. At just 22 years old he released the visionary and era defining EP "CMYK", and at 23 his first album, "James Blake", earned unanimous praise and proved a worldwide success. His first two albums revealed the building blocks and constants of his sound, namely; crisp production, mastery of bass frequencies, the combination of organic and digital elements, his natural talent on the piano and his mesmerising vocals. These attributes were amply demonstrated on his second - for some, even better - album "Overgrown", which deservedly won the Mercury Music Prize and led to a Grammy Nomination for Best New Artist. With his star fixed, Blake has recently been sharing new material in anticipation of his new album, both online and as part of his concerts. For example: a version of "The Sound of Silence" by Simon and Garfunkel, a BBC Radio1 residency, and a live broadcast where he played part of a song from his new album (its title track) mixed with a Bill Withers cover version.
