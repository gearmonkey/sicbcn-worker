Roots Manuva
Hip-hop exemplified
Widely admired, respected and considered to be one of Britain’s most important hip-hop MCs, in 2015 Roots Manuva released his sixth studio album, "Bleeds". The vocalist from Stockwell worked on the new album with the young English producer Fred, as well as collaborating with heavyweights including Four Tet, Adrian Sherwood and Switch. Together they have created an album of mature and insightful compositions that exude wisdom and see him take full command of his own sound. Manuva returns turns to his characteristic soulful vibe (with Barry White samples included), dub, Jazz-funk and elements of techno that add intricate nuances to his rugged brand of hip-hop. His presence alone on the SónarHall stage raises the bar at this year’s festival.

Rodney Smith came to prominece in 1999 with the release of his debut album "Brand New Second Hand" that took the UK and worldwide hip-hop scene by storm. Since then under the umbrella of the Big Dada label, an imprint of Ninja Tune created to broadcast the UK’s best rap and urban rhythms, Smith has developed a rock solid career (with classic albums like "Awfully Deep" and "Run Come Save Me"). He has skilfully avoided the trappings of fame and remains somewhat elusive, maintaining a spirituality inherited from his father, a West Indian preacher. Manuva is now recognised as a progenitor of grime, and throughout his career he has constantly pushed at the limits of his sound, thanks to collaborations with artists including Jamie Cullum, DJ Shadow, UNKLE, The Cinematic Orchestra, Gorillaz, Beth Orton and Coldcut, among many others.
