Ben UFO b2b Helena Hauff
Four prodigious hands
Sónar 2016 and Resident Advisor are honoured to bring together for the very first time, a DJ set from two of the most exciting and relevant DJs today: the widely respected Brit; Hessle Audio label boss Ben UFO; and Germany's Helena Hauff, resident DJ at the cult Golden Pudel club in Hamburg and an outstanding producer of infectious dark techno. Both will convene behind the decks at Sónar by Night in what is looking to be one of the sets of the festival; we can expect to hear an abundance of high quality unreleased material, dance floor friendly techno, EBM, oblique house and as yet unheard mixes from them both. What a luxurious treat for Sónar by Night.

For many years both Ben and Helena have received much deserved respect and praise from both specialist press and the discerning public alike. The English DJ has slowly become one of the world's most admired DJs without feeling the need to produce. This has allowed him to fully concentrate all his creativity on his continuously impeccable and open-minded sets, which combine the best in techno, experimental breaks, tribal tracks and any sounds that inspire him. His kudos can easily be measured by the amount of other DJs that regard him so highly. Meanwhile Hauff has taken a major step forward from her home in Hamburg to the forefront of the European techno scene, without ever betraying her passion for industrial rhythms, dark and minimal wave and underground electronica. Her quality is perfectly embodied by "Discreet Desires" her latest album on Werk (Actress' label), as well as her singles on Ninja Tune and PAN and her experimental project Black Sites.
