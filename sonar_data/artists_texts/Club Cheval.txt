Club Cheval
Killer quartet
Consisting of Sam Tiba, Myd, Canblaster and Panteros666, Club Cheval are take-no-prisoners party starters of the highest order. Originally surfacing via releases on Top Billin’ and Bromance Records, the ubiquitous Frenchmen effortlessly fuse electro, house and Underground Resistance-style electronics to create their trademark high energy sound, in plentiful supply on their roaring EP From The Basement To The Roof and latest collaborative single “Discipline.” In the past, Club Cheval have remixed the likes of Boys Noize, Two Door Cinema Club and Vitalic, and Club Cheval member Canblaster is also an RBMA alumnus, with a background in making music for computer games that informs the pixelated atmospheres, furious changes and power-ups in his solo tracks.
