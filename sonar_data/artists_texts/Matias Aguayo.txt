Matias Aguayo
Tasty Bass
Friday at SonarVillage will close in the best possible way, with a succulent, otherworldly, dance set from the mighty Matias Aguayo. The Chilean producer based in Frankfurt is on top form: he has recently released a raft of genre pushing material including the raw dance of the four "El Rudo's House" EPs and the deeper techno of "Legend" on Kompakt; has launched new group Rionegro (with Sano and Gladkazuka); and still masterfully runs his own label Cómeme, perhaps the finest exponent of Latin electronica in the world. Each time Aguayo takes to the stage he unleashes his artistic nature, mixing mutant techno with luscious house, using his voice as extra instrument while somehow performing seemingly impossible choreographed dance routines. Aguayo is a showman, but above all is a superlative artist.

Matias Aguayo was a key name in 90s German electronic music thanks to his electro, dark new wave and ambient productions with Dirk Leyers as Closer Musik. He is a long time associate of Michael Mayer’s Kompakt empire and has always maintained his taste and predeliction for Latin rhythms, which naturally began to flourish while he was honing his skills as a producer and singer. As a solo artist this first came to fruition with the singles "minimal" and his first album "Are You Really Lost?" later followed by the sensational "Ay Ay Ay" and "The Visitor" LPs full of clearly Latin influenced hits like "The Sucu Tucu" and" Rollerskate". He founded Cómeme in 2009 releasing music from artists such as Mexico's Rebolledo – his partner in crime typically found on stage or in the studio with him during that time- and for uncovering new producers such as Daniel Maloso, Ana Helder, Lena Willikens and Alejandro Paz.
