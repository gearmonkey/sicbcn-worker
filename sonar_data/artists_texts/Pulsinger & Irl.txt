Pulsinger & Irl
Analog couple
Pulsinger & Irl is the collaborative project between Austrian producer and techno pioneer Patrick Pulsinger, and Bavarian producer and sound engineer Sam Irl. Their cooperation began a few years ago behind the mixing board of Patrick Pulsinger’s Feedback Studio in Vienna, where Sam Irl started out working as his assistant recording engineer. Hailing from different musical backgrounds, they found a mutual connection between experimental techno, sample-heavy dub and jazz, and their love for analog machinery. Their live set aims at capturing the essential vibe of live-performed techno and house music, working only with drum computers, a MPC sampler, analog synthesizers and a series of dub-heavy effects recalling the atmosphere of Jamaican dub culture, early Detroit techno and contemporary electronics. For over 20 years, Patrick Pulsinger has been releasing music on his own label, Cheap Records, as well as numerous international imprints like R&S, M Plant and Disko B, and worked as a producer with artists like DJ Hell, Hercules & Love Affair, Elektro Guzzi, Fennesz and many more. Sam Irl has released his music on labels such as Gilles Peterson’s Brownswood Recordings (together with Ritornell), Jazz & Milk, Bonzzaj Rec. (together with Dorian Concept), Frank Music and Pulver Records.
