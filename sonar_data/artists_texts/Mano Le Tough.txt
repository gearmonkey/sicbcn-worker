Mano Le Tough
Worldwide class
Little by little Niall Manion has become one of the European scene’s most popular and in demand DJs, playing weekly in clubs and major festivals around the world, often sharing the bill with the likes of DJs Dixon, John Talabot, Axel Boman and Floating Points. His exquisite taste and unique ability to select the very best in modern house music are qualities that have been present throughout his career. Now a globally renowned artist, he first received recognition from the cognoscenti in his adopted city, Berlin. Manion has also perfected his skills as a remixer and producer in a similar vein to his career as a DJ: Moving unhurriedly with consummate ease, with a clear and concise idea of which direction to take. In 2015 he consolidated his position as an artist largely thanks to the release of "Trails", his second and most ambitious album to date, released on Permanent Vacation. It is an album that further underlines his understanding of house music, concentrating on it's emotional charge as well as its physical effect.

Hailing from Ireland and recently relocating to Zurich, Manion has spent much of his career operating from Berlin. He began to forge his current reputation in the German capital by playing at the city’s key clubs and actively participating in its legendary nightlife scene. Since 2009 he has released his own material on labels like Mirau and Internasjonal. By 2012 he had already established himself as a leading DJ on the on the European scene and released his first material on Permanent Vacation, starting with the 12" "Mountains", later followed by the album "Changing Days". The two LPs (and single) focused on the more accessible side of his work, meanwhile in the DJ booth he continued to demonstrate his razor-sharp and versatile taste, mixing electronic dance music in all its guises with supreme precision.
