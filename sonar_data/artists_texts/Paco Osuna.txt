Paco Osuna
Worldwide dj
Paco Osuna is now one of Spain’s most internationally renowned artists. He is also undoubtedly the most travelled, playing worldwide at all kinds of venues, festivals and events in Europe, Asia, America, and beyond. Osuna’s career spans more than 20 years and is typified by hard work; a powerful and flexible sound that can adapt to any given situation; and the constant search for new musical expression. All of his sets are important to him. He maintains his fresh approach and energy through invention and constant renewal, and is fully committed to each performance regardless of the location or occasion. This year he will take control of one of the festival’s key slots, by playing the closing set at SonarClub, the biggest stage at Sónar by Night.

Immersing himself in techno and dance music since his formative years, at just 20 years old Osuna founded his first label and became the resident DJ at the legendary Ibiza club Amnesia. This period on the Magic Island brought him into contact with famous figures from the international scene including Sven Väth, Carl Cox, Marco Carola and, of course, Richie Hawtin. More than ten years on, Hawtin and Osuna continue to work together and maintain a close personal and artistic relationship. Along with his infectious charisma and experience behind the decks, Osuna also ran Barcelona’s Club4 Mindshake night as well as having released tracks on labels like Plus 8, Spectral and M_nus; consolidating his reputation among lovers of minimal and dark techno throughout the world.
