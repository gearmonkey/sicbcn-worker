Acid Arab
Fusion of worlds
In their own unique way, Parisians Guido Minisky and Herve Carvalho have given birth to a new form of world music: an intense and sharp techno and house sound seamlessly blended with melodies, harmonies, chants and Arabic sounds. The result is one of the most exciting fusions of global electronic dance sounds that can be heard today; modern, intoxicating, and powerfully evocative music. Just take a look at any of thier videos on YouTube, watch their sets (e.g. the excellent mix for French magazine Tsugi) or listen to the recent "Djazirat el Maghreb EP" and fall under the spell of a sound that combines the best dance sounds from both Eastern and Western cultures.

It all started when Minisky and Carvalho -both experienced club DJs and residents at Paris’s Chez Moune- travelled to Tunisia together with another key name of French electronica, dj Gilb'R. Fascinated by what they heard they began to experiment with these sounds, sharing their discoveries with other like-minded producers and musicians, who were invited to join the project. Henceforth came the singles and the subsequent compilation "Acid Arab Collections" a high tide mark of today’s Arab Acid project, which included the participation of among others Crackboy (remixing Omar Souleyman), Pilooski, Etienne Jaumet and I: Cube. Since then, and with the support of label Versatile (run by Gilb'R), the Parisian duo has continued to explore their exquisite combination of acid and Maghreb music (and beyond: Kurdistan, Pakistan, India) in dj sessions, remixes and EPs, to a powerful and addictive effect.
