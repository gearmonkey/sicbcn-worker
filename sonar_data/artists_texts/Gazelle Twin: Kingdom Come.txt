Gazelle Twin: Kingdom Come
An Audio-Visual Performance for Two Vocalists
The british artist Gazelle Twin will touch down at SonarComplex with a new show combining theatre, live music and new forms of storytelling, which will also play a major role at Sónar+D. "Kingdom Come" evokes the dystopian worlds of JG Ballard by merging on stage: images of empty shopping centres and car parks -created by filmmakers Chris Turner and Tash Tung-; an arresting presence of vocalists; and strange gym treadmills. The show was produced by Manchester's FutureEverything festival, and will be performed at Sónar by Day for only the third time since its creation.

Behind the enigmatic name and image of Gazelle Twin is Brighton based artist and composer Elizabeth Bernholz. Her work is characterized by the creation of dark and dystopian universes, a desire to tackle challenging issues and an unconventional approach to performance. Her album "Unflesh" (2014) is a visceral meditation on puberty and phobias and was chosen as album of the year by the prestigious online magazine The Quietus, while receiving numerous accolades in The Guardian, Uncut and the New York Times. Over the past year she has been working on the piece "Out Of Body" with Carla MacKinnon and has toured the world presenting "Fleshed Out", a live version of the album, as well as working tirelessly on the "Kingdom Come" project.
