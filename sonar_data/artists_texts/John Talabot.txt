John Talabot
Closing Friday in style
Talabot returns to Sónar having -on his own merits- become one of the leading and most revered names on the international scene. The Barcelona dj and producer will be handed the task of closing Friday night at the SónarPub stage, where he will play one of his transcendental sets, mixing exquisite house while delving into cosmic disco, deep techno or various manifestations of bass music. He is currently working on his long-awaited second album, and just recently completed two remixes of "Loud Places", a song from the latest album by label mate Jamie xx. Talabot will take a break from the studio to close proceedings on Friday at Sónar by Night.

Spain’s foremost producer of electronica has now made the jump to the world's major leagues. John Talabot (Oriol Riverola on his passport) first began to establish his much deserved reputation with two singles on Permanent Vacation, "My Old School" and "Sunshine" in 2009. By this time Oriol had already gained considerable experience in the Barcelona club under his former alias, D.A.R.Y.L.; he then released singles on Young Turks and, of course, received huge recognition for his fantastic debut album, "ƒin" (Permanent Vacation, 2012). Talabot’s sensitivity and feel are especially evident in his work as head of Hivern Discs, the impeccable label whose catalogue is helping define the very best in contemporary European house music. He recently formed duo Talaboman together with Sweden’s Axel Boman, and has actively decided to reduce his number of concerts and dj sets, in order to devote more time to his studio production and to writing new compositions for his second album. Yet another reason to celebrate the presence of this superstar at Sónar 2016.
