Though he’s largely working within a freeform ambient structure, Sebastián De los Ríos pulls plenty of texture and emotion from layered drone. You might hear what sounds like a field recording of cars driving through puddles, or crunchy static that starts to sound like a heavy rainstorm, before a warm wash of keys overpowers everything. It makes sense then, that this Barcelona resident studies sound art and programs music for sound installations – his music seems to exist side-by-side with the real world, while creating a whole new environment to explore.
