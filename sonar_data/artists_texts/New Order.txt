New Order
Back on top
Once again, New Order are the the name on everyone’s lips thanks to their new album "Music Complete", which has been unanimously heralded as one of the best in their career, equalling the dizzy heights of classics like "Technique" or "Republic". It has been almost ten years since the legendary English group released a studio album, but the long wait has been rewarded with an album that recaptures some of their key traits: perfect melodies, the ageless voice of Bernard Sumner, the Peter Saville cover design and the return of Gillian Gilbert to the band. "Music Complete" includes collaborations with La Roux, Iggy Pop, Tom Rowlands and Brandon Flowers, and we must not forget that the album appears on Daniel Miller’s label Mute, and sees him in the role of executive producer. Everything is therefore once again in place for New Order, who will arrive at Sónar by Night armed with a collection of new songs that seamlessly blend with timeless classics like "Bizarre Love Triangle", "True Faith", "Temptation" and "Blue Monday".

New Order need little introduction. Rising from the ashes of Joy Division with remarkable vigour and a new sound, to become one of the most important and influential groups of the last 30 years. From the very beginning it was clear that New Order would change the course of pop. This was soon to be confirmed in 1983 with the astonishing impact of "Blue Monday", the best-selling dance track in history. The rest as they say is history: a handful of masterpieces ("Power, Corruption & Lies," "Brotherhood", "Low Life"), world tours, countless accolades and a legacy of magnificent songs that have inspired (and continue to inspire) thousands of bands and artists the world over.
