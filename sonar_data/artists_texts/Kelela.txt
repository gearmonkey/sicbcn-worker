Kelela
Rising star
Part of a new and very exciting breed of r&b singers (Abra, Alexandria, Dawn Richard, etc.) Kelela is noted for her versatility and ability to adapt to contemporary mainstream electronica. In 2013 her debut "Cut 4 Me" took the world by storm and was featured on numerous best of year lists. Her latest EP "Hallucinogen" (released on Warp) demonstrates her unique talent as an ever-evolving artist on the rise. Everything about her is special: her name (last name Mizanekristos) of Ethiopian origin; her stunning beauty; her incredibly versatile voice; her eye-catching videos and the unparalleled magnetism of her stage presence. Even more special are the six songs on "Hallucinogen", lyrically stark and sincere with futuristic and captivating production techniques, featuring participation from Ark, Daniel Pineda, Kingdom and Nguzunguzu among others.

Kelela was born in Washington DC and began her musical career as part of the house duo Teengirl Fantasy. However her big break came thanks to the Fade To Mind family, sister label of the British Night Slugs imprint. A number of artists from the two highly regarded labels (Bok Bok, Nguzunguzu, Girl Unit, Kingdom and Jam City, among others) collaborated on her debut release, "Cut 4 Me", providing killer beats and futuristic bass lines, perfect for showcasing her considerable vocal skills. The album received plaudits from none other than Bj√∂rk, and also received rave reviews across America and Europe. Following the album came collaborations with Kindness, Obey City and Future Brown; her signing to Warp; and the release of the extraordinary "Hallucinogen". Kelela moves with considerable ease between mutant soul, cutting edge beats and contemporary r&b, and has already established herself as one of the most important singers of her generation. Justifiably.
