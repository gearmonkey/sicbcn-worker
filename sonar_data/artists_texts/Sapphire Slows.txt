Sapphire Slows
Opposites atract
Sapphire Slows is what you might call an everything-ist: she produces, DJs, plays synth and keyboard, and her eerie, drone-like vocals float over her tracks, embellishing their shadowy textures. After the brutal awakening of the 2011 earthquakes in Japan, she became motivated to pursue a career in music. Now a notable name in Tokyo’s house scene, she has toured North America, Europe, China and her home country, and released on labels such as Japan’s Big Love and Los Angeles’ 100% Silk. While some of her songs are submerged in a blue-ish, slo-mo haze, like her name suggests, others are more abrasive and in tune with the whirring pace of krautrock, as on 2014’s Allegoria album. A keen interest in crate digging, a healthy disregard for music nostalgia and her own lucid dreams help root Sapphire Slows' music in the future.
