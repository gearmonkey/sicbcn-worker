Zero vs. Chelis
Two for the road
Friday night at SonarPub couldn't possibly get off to a better start: a face-off between two of Spain’s most respected and admired Djs, Zero and Chelis. The Catalan and his Spanish brother in arms have known each other for years, crossing paths many times. However, while it is true they have shared the decks on some improvised occasions, they have never played together back to back in an "official" act. Their backgrounds and musical tastes are so wide ranging that they can integrate any genre and spectrum of sound they please: in this case, the idea is to join together a collage of beats, drones and library music, before the new live show from Anhoni with Oneohtrix Point Never and Hudson Mohawke.

Raül G. Pratginestós, better known as Zero, is one of Spain’s most experienced and versatile Djs, a key figure in the Barcelona scene, unanimously respected by his peers since the early years of the electronic music explosion. He played at the very first Sónar, in 1994, and twenty years on his reputation remains undiminished. Meanwhile, Chelis has spent two decades imparting his passion, humour and unparalleled musical knowledge in each and every one of his dj sets, whatever style he plays (and he plays them all). He is also founder of label Lo Fi Funk, which operates in the territory of low-fidelity synthetic funk, one of his many passions.
