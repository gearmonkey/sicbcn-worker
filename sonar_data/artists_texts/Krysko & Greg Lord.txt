Krysko & Greg Lord
Mancunian idols
The 2016 collaboration between SÃ³nar and Manchester club The Warehouse Project would not be complete without two resident DJs, Krysko & Greg Lord. Both DJs are heroes of their city's nightlife and are well known in the wider British club scene. They will offer one of their accomplished sets at SonarLab on Saturday night, sharing the stage with leading artists including Ben Klock, Stormzy and Bicep. Both refuse to define their style: preferring to let the music do the talking. Their sets are open to potentially any sound and rhythm conceivable and are replete with variety and imaginative mixes. Their masterly touch clearly demonstrates the years of experience they have accumulated behind the decks.

Krysko is the oldest resident of the Manchester club. He has previously recorded two mixes for the BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix series and is a regular fixture in line-ups for the best clubs and festivals in the UK and America. He has also released a couple of EPs on labels like Peaches (Chicago) and Whatever. Much like his regular accomplice in the DJ booth, Greg Lord has also played at many of the most popular festivals in UK and has increasingly played in the clubs of Ibiza, where he debuted at none other than Space.
