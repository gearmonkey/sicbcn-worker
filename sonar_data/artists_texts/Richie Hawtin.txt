Richie Hawtin
The debut of a brand new show
Debuting a completely new show at Sónar 2016, which will be presented officially within the next weeks, Richie Hawtin takes another giant leap forward in his dedication to music, art and technology.

At the end of 2015, this Canadian creative - an artist constantly in touch with the present and near future - released the excellent "From My Mind To Yours", an LP that resurrects many of the aliases that Hawtin has used throughout his career (Plastikman, Circuit Breaker, F.U.S.E.), while updating the signature sound that has made him one of the most consistently relevant figures in electronica. Recently having contributed again to BBC Radio 1's Essential Mix series, as well as announcing his collaboration in the creation of a new music hardware, Hawtin is, as ever, a man in constant momentum.

As well as these more recent endeavours, Hawtin has been working ferociously over the last few years - from the curation of his ENTER. events to his collaborations with Turner Prize winning artist Anish Kapoor, or the Italian coreographer Enzo Cosimi. Indefatigable and polifacetic, he's also completed a lecture tour of North American universities with the CNTRL concept, composed an alternative soundtrack for the 1928 silent film 'Brume d'Automne' , and returned to his Plastikman alias with a full length record 'EX' and a corresponding live show that he performed at Sónar 2014.
