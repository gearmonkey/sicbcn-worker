Kerri Chandler
House spirit
Friday night at SonarLab will feature deep house music luminary: Kerri Chandler, one of the genre’s most respected names and a legend on the American underground scene. Chandler’s musical background can be traced back to listening to many hours of jazz with his father (a DJ like him) during his childhood and adolescence in his native New Jersey, and of course, via the house and garage scene in neighbouring New York City. This heritage is essential to his sound and is clearly evident in both his productions and DJ sets, which always carry a deep spiritual message. Chandler’s house sound leans more towards Africa than Chicago with: more soul than ghetto, more jazz than electro, and more funk than techno. That said, Chandler is open minded to a fault and his sets are mixed with an astonishing fluidity, incorporating both cutting edge and classic tracks, without ever losing the warmth and human energy of the dance floor.

Chandler has remained true to his vision of living and understanding music since his first singles saw the light in the early 90's. He is a man of strong religious beliefs, whilst simultaneously fascinated by the new possibilities offered by technology. The American DJ and producer has founded several labels (Madhouse and Madtech Records, among others) and is said to have released more than 100 albums during his 25-year career. He recently shared some of his older tracks online ("Get it Off", released under the moniker Three Generations, and the long player “Into The Night”, which remains unreleased). He continues to DJ and plays at clubs and events around the world. It is an honour to have him perform at this year's festival.
