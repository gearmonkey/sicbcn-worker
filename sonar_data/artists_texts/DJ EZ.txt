DJ EZ
UK Garage Legend
DJ EZ is the personification of the UK garage sound, the London based genre which in his hands still sounds as fresh and magnetic as when it first appeared. Originally from Tottenham, North London, the legendary DJ EZ (Otis Roberts) has been fully active over the last few years. His incredible sets combine the very best in today’s garage, bass music and London style house, with the classics of the late 90s and early 2000s. His mixing expertise and sound selection is perfectly demonstrated by last year’s set for the Essential Mix series, two hours of pure London music without a single wasted second. DJ EZ debuts at Sónar on Saturday night at SonarLab, and expectations could not be higher.

DJ EZ’s (pronounced EEE ZED) fame and reputation is entirely deserved. His long-standing experience and technical skills enable him to dominate the art of mixing like no other, and his genre knowledge of garage, 2 step, grime and UK funky is encyclopaedic. He has experienced moments of huge success in a career that began on pirate radio stations: the genre defining compilation mix series "Pure Garage"; his amazing Boiler Room set in 2012, a landmark in the British platform’s output; and his contribution to the London club Fabric cd-mix series. Recently DJEZ also took part in a one of a kind fundraising initiative; a 24 hour DJ set, raising over 60,000 pounds for Cancer Research UK.
