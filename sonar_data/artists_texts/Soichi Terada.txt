Soichi Terada
The Godfather of Japanese house
"Sounds From The Far East", last year’s excellent compilation distributed by Rush Hour has finally put a particular problem to bed: to make the western public aware (especially the younger generation) of veteran Japanese music producer Soichi Terada, who since the 90s has been one of the Tokyo house scene’s most important figures. The album, chosen by Resident Advisor as the most important compilation of 2015, reveals the wondrous sound of Terada: American-inspired house music with simple warmth, irresistible melodies, arpeggios and arrangements rooted in the Japanese tradition (close to those of Yellow Magic Orchestra, for example), and an emotional facet rare for dance music.

Terada's career spans almost 30 years, from the late 80s to the present day, with his first official release coming in 1988. Although connoisseurs of global electronica and house music have revered his excellent albums and his work as head of Far East Recordings for a long time, there are many people who have probably heard his music without even realising it. For instance, he created the soundtrack for seven iterations of the famous Playstation video game "Ape Escape" launched in 1999. More recently Terada featured on "Sounds From The Far East" (compiled by DJ and Dutch producer Hunee), helping him open the gates to Europe and Sónar by Night, where for the first time we can enjoy live, his elegant, sensitive and captivating disco-garage-house.
