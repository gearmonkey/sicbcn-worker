Undo
Experience is a plus
Few national DJs are better prepared to handle the opening set at SonarClub on Saturday night, just before the New Order concert. Gabriel Berlanga -the man better known as Undo- more than meets the requirements: a flawless technique, years of experience, extremely knowledgeable about electronic and techno-pop music, and fan of the band since their inception. More than two decades of experience in major clubs and events around the world allow him to adapt to any situation, especially when playing a landmark set such as this at Sónar by Night.

Berlanga began collecting records, DJing and experimenting with electronic sounds in the mid-90s, playing around with old synthesizers, samplers and loop-guitar effects. However, it was not until 2002 that he began to write and produce under the name Undo. Founder of the Factor City label and resident for several years at The Loft / Lolita, the DJ and producer from Barcelona has released two LPS, "Despacio" (Factor City, 2006) and "Motas de Polvo" (Factor City, 2012); has remixed Delorean, Miss Kittin, Glimpse and Dorian, among many others; and has travelled the world, playing at clubs including Panorama Bar Berlin, the Rex in Paris and London’s Fabric. His most recent work is the "Aeromuerto" EP, released late last year on Berlin label Beachcoma.
