Ed Banger House Party: Busy P + Para One + Boston Bun
Party in Village
Among French house labels, Ed Banger is perhaps the most important, and its roster of artists like Busy P, Para One and Boston Bun best define the label’s current output. All three share a hedonistic spirit, a love of dance music, lack of prejudice and abundant skills behind the decks. They will close Saturday at SónarVillage (and therefore the day shift of Sónar 2016), which is set to be truly memorable. Expect large doses of house both old and new, cosmic disco, mutant funk, bombastic hip-hop beats and endless dance-floor gems for a nonstop dancing experience.

Thibaud Noyer, aka Boston Bun, has effortlessly slotted into the Ed Banger family thanks to the quality of his music which fluctuates between sophisticated house and dance-floor electro. His latest 12" perhaps best defines him as a producer with its compact sound and by its title: "Paris Groove". Long-time acquaintances of famous rap group TTC, Para One retain hip-hop in their DNA while also moving towards an electronic sound rich in nuances and rhythms, embodied by noteworthy albums including "Passion" (2012) and "Club" (2014). Meanwhile Pedro Winter -Busy P- still heads the group he founded 12 years ago, fresh from being Daft Punk’s manager in their early years. As a dj he has become a key ambassador for the Paris scene and French electronica throughout the world.
