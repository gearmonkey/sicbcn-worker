Magic Mountain High
Real synth live
The trio of Move D and Juju & Jordash make up the improvising group Magic Mountain High. For each one of them, improvisation is more than just creating something on the spot: it informs their whole attitude to live performance and music making. In this day and age of pre-programmed laptop sets, Magic Mountain High aim to bring the moment back to the dancefloor, capturing the artistry back from convenience and giving the dancers something they can cherish. Stripping each set down to the bare essentials, the group use a changing combination of synths, drum machines and effects, and then perform on the fly, each time something different. After jamming at Move Dâ€™s studio, the trio really came together for good when both parties were asked to perform the soundtrack to 1920s cult film Der Golem. They decided to do it together and have been surprising themselves at various venues and festivals ever since.
