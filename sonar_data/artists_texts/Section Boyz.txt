Section Boyz
Road Rap
Section Boyz are the new hip-hop sensation in the UK. Originating from south London, the group formed by Swift, Deepee, Sleeks, Knine, Inch & Littlez are revolutionizing the English capital’s long-standing rap scene. Up until this point they have only released the mixtape, "Don't Panic", but -as also transpired with PXXR GVNG in Spain- the key to their success is their dazzling array of videos, where the quality of their sound and lyrics is patently obvious. At the time of writing the "Trapping Ain’t Dead" video has already been seen by two million people, and "Delete My Number" by one and a half million and counting. Although they are connected to the grime world (being friends with new genre leaders like Stormzy) their sound is more akin to high-powered hip hop, finding the perfect balance between its classical forms and the latest production techniques of trap and cloud rap, leaving sufficient space for the lyrical flow to shine. Just recently they were named the best group / debut artist of the year at the MOBO Awards, which is sure to be the first of many. The Section Boyz sound is some serious bizness.
