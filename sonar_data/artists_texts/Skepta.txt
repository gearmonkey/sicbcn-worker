Skepta
Grime star
After last year’s super-charged concert with his brother JME, the king of grime returns to Sónar. This time he will perform solo to close the SónarDôme stage and present his highly anticipated fourth album "Konnichiwa", almost five years after "Doin 'It Again". It comes at a time in which grime has made a powerful return to the forefront of the international scene. This has allowed Skepta’s talent to finally receive the recognition it deserves beyond London and the UK, and sees him transcending genre boundaries, rubbing shoulders with leading figures in the rap and pop world. The Tottenham MC has formed a partnership with Drake to remix a track by Nigerian singer Wizkid; has appeared in a short film directed by A$AP Rocky at the Kanye West concert in London; has achieved global success with "That's Not Me" and "Shutdown"; and received honours for his "outstanding contribution to music" at the British Independent Music Awards.

Joseph Junior Adenuga of Nigerian origin, began as a dj for the Meridian Crew more than a decade ago, before temporarily joining Roll Deep, one of grime culture’s key collectives. In 2006 he founded label Boy Better Know, releasing several mixtapes, twenty EPs and the albums "Greatest Hits", "Microphone Champion" and "Doin 'It Again" with his brother. Restless and resourceful, at the start of the year Skepta recorded a mixtape together with Tim Westwood that he then distributed on the streets of New York; and he recently included several verses on a new remix of Jamie xx "I know there's gonna be (good times)". He is most definitely on a roll.
