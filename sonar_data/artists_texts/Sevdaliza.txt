Sevdaliza
Dark seduction
Rotterdam’s Sevdaliza comes through with a voice that could melt butter, bass that will blow your speakers, and the kind of otherworldly effects that speak of her ability to conjure up strange new feelings and wondrous worlds. Born in Tehran and raised in The Netherlands, this former basketball star and rapper has transformed into a straight-up siren: churning out catchy, sexy electro one second, then melting it all down into a dark and twisted experimental fantasy the next. A perfectionist when it comes to sound design, Sevdaliza nonetheless writes very intuitively. “I never force a song", she says. The Fader and Noisey have already been seduced by Sevdaliza’s talent. Don’t be surprised if you’re next.
