Coyu
Night cat
Known throughout the European circuit as “The Big Cat”, Catalan Coyu has long been one of the major producers and DJs on the international house and techno scene, a status well-earned thanks to his patience, self-confidence and the excellence of his work as head of Suara, the label whose releases havewho have regularly charted on Beatport and Resident Advisor since its inception in 2008. This year, with the feline aesthetic of Coyu and Suara coinciding with the image of Sónar 2016, he will play a set at Sónar by Night on Saturday 18 following New Order. The set will also feature visuals from his usual onstage accomplice, GaAs, where cats will be omnipresent.

After remixing artists like Fatboy Slim, Pete Tong, Moby or Stephan Bodzin, Coyu threw himself into his own music with great success, producing tracks including “The Cat” (Hot Creations), “Profound Pleasure” (Defected) “Balls”, “Cygnus” (the latter two on Suara) and others for Innervisions and Drumcode. Since then he has tirelessly toured the world and expanded his fan base, regularly sharing the booth with dj luminaries, while releasing material on labels like Get Physical, Bedrock and Cocoon.
