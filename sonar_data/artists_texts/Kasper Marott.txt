Kasper Marott
Rhythms & textures
Kasper Marott spends his days crafting both sprawling, improvised ambient soundscapes and propulsive techno thumps. He finds a similarly sprawling space in both styles, bouncing rhythms and textures alike through his weapon of choice, a Korg Stage Echo. This stylistic breadth is informed by a musical curiosity â€“ the Danish producer scans the radio airwaves and deep mines the Discogs archives for new tunes. His debut EP was released on Horse On Horse in 2014.
