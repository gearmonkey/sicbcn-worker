Bicep
Muscular house
As Bicep, Matt McBriar and Andy Ferguson have created their own unique world: a creative nucleus, a popular DJ team and an extended identity through the Feel My Bicep alias, their blog and publishing platform. Each of their brands is synonymous with robust energetic house music, as deep as it is magnetic, flirting with both Detroit techno and an underground disco sound. Since they first began releasing albums five years ago, they have not stopped producing and putting out material: just last year they released four EPs, two of them on their own label, one on Aus Music and another on 50Weapons, the latter together with Benjamin Damage and Doc Daneeka. The Northern Irish duo have perfectly assimilated their sources of inspiration and know exactly how to shape them into a concise and individual sound, ideal at winning over any dance floor in any given situation.

For nearly a decade McBriar and Ferguson’s activity has been extremely intense: they have collaborated and shared releases with other prominent names from the British scene including: Ejeca, Simian Mobile Disco and Midland; they have remixed Blood Orange, Disclosure, Blondes and Catalans, Aster, among others; In 2014 they recorded one of the best Essential Mixes for BBC Radio 1; and have released almost twenty singles, EPs and tracks on labels like Throne of Blood, Traveller and Aus. As if this were not enough; in addition to running their own label and regularly updating their blog; they are common fixtures at some of the world’s biggest club nights, including of course, Manchester’s Warehouse Project.
