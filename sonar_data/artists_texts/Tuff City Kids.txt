Tuff City Kids
German class
Tuff City Kids is the production and performance duo of Phillip Lauer and Gerd Janson. In addition to releases of their own via Unterton, Delsin, Permanent Vacation and more, Tuff City Kids have become in-demand remixers as well, with a special talent for recontextualization that doesn’t distract from the eclectic energy they’re able to consistently supply - Azari & III, Tensnake, Sinkane, Avalon Emerson, Scuba and the Juan Maclean are just a small selection of the artists who have called on Tuff City Kids to supply sweaty grooves. In 2015, Tuff City Kids kept busy with releases via Live at Robert Johnson and Potion, as well as playing live all over the world. It’s an understated but effective duo, not making a big fuss out of their obvious talent and preferring to let the music do the talking.
