Trill Squad: Toner + Sanatruja
Hybridizations and futurisms
Trill is the future beats and hip-hop Saturday club night that has successfully been running for more than two years at Razzmatazz in Barcelona. Key figures to pass through its door include TroyBoi, Shlohmo, Evian Christ, Bauer, RP Boo and Yung Beef, among many others. But, like any great club,  the main strength of Trill is its residents: the Trill Squad is formed by a growing alliance of Barcelona DJs and producers such as Downites, Enpunto and Will Blake. On this occasion, the collective will arrive at Sónar with its two founding members, Toner and Sanatruja. They will offer a special set focused on the emotional spectrum of new electronica: from vaporwave to cloud rap, through to post-grime and all kinds of r&b hybridizations.

Toner has spent more than 10 years as resident DJ in Barcelona clubs (particularly BeCool and Razzmatazz) and has played at several national festivals. He is also in charge of the collective’s careful branding and image. Meanwhile Sanatruja (who returns to Sónar after his 2014 performance) also carries a wealth of experience behind the DJ booth in Razzmatazz, and is responsible for the Trill club night’s programming. Their joint set will open the SonarLab stage on Saturday night, right before the Mura Masa concert.
