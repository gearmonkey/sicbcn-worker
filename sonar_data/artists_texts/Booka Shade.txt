Booka Shade
Dance revision
Booka Shade will be presenting the world premiere of their new show at Sónar by Night. 'Movements 10' is a jaw dropping production that includes lasers, cutting edge light design and visuals crafted especially for the show, which celebrates the 10th anniversary of their era-defining LP 'Movements'. As well as the show the duo have re-issued the album in a remastered edition featuring remixes by Nils Frahm, Deetron, M.A.N.D.Y. and Eats Everything (who plays immediately following their show at SonarClub).

Merziger and Kammermeier founded influential label Get Physical in 2002, together with M.A.N.D.Y. and DJ T. They also contributed directly to the label’s expansion releasing their first three LPs, “Memento” (2004), “Movements” (2006) & “The Sun & The Neon Light” (2008), followed by “More!” (2010) and “Eve” (2013). In addition to their proven skills in effortlessly combining irresistible rhythms with melodic hooks, the Berlin duo has always stood out for their spectacular live shows, which constantly feature among the favourites in the annual Resident Advisor lists. This led them to be chosen by Depeche Mode as road and stage companions for one of their recent tours. They have also produced several remixes for artists and bands including Moby, Yello, Hot Chip, Tiga and The Knife, among many others.
