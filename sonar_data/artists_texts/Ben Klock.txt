Ben Klock
Hard & heart
A fixture in Resident Advisor’s top-10 DJs for the best part of a decade, Ben Klock needs little introduction. With a long-term residency at Berghain, it is with the notorious Berlin institution that he is most commonly associated, but the intricate yet powerful nature of his sets have seen him become one of most in-demand techno artists of the current generation. Those who have witnessed him perform will note not only the diversity in his track selection, but also his ability to create a room rather than just play for it. Focus, over recent years, has been on touring—but his early works, released primarily via Ostgut Ton, have become landmark releases in the imprint’s impressive discography. His seminal 2009 album, titled “One,” continues to form a reference point for all long-players within the techno genre. In addition to this, he also runs Klockworks, a label founded in 2006 that has housed releases from DVS1, Etapp Kyle and Klock himself.
