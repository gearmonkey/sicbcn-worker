Jamie Woon
Contemporary crooner
2008 Red Bull Music Academy alumnus Jamie Woon first rose to prominence as a definitive voice of the post-dubstep generation, having collaborated with Burial on his acclaimed 2010 underground hit “Night Air” and later signing to Polydor for his debut LP Mirrorwriting. With a celestial voice, exceptional songwriting skills and a knack for utilizing folky textures within ethereal electronic pop, Woon has an unparalleled talent for remaking the familiar in his own unique image. It’s been an active few years since for the modern-day troubadour, with Woon guesting on Disclosure’s “January,” collaborating with Portico and releasing his second LP Making Time in late 2015 via PMR.
