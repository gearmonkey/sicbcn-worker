John Grvy
Synth soul charisma
John Grvy is the electronic project of the young Madrid-born singer J.E.Edward. He easily and gently moves around chillwave, new wave R&B and electronic neosoul. Think in a transmutation of Hudson Mohawke, Frank Ocean or James Blake coming into one figure. Despite his youth, his self-confidence on stage and his great band are powerful enough to showcase an impressive show, seen in several festivals and venues across the county. After a couple of EPs, heâ€™s releasing his first album in 2016 at the Red Bull Studios network. Definitely, a young promise to look at.
