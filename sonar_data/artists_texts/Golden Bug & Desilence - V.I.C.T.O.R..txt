Golden Bug & Desilence - V.I.C.T.O.R.
Mapping sound
V.I.C.T.O.R. is a new audiovisual live show that unites French producer Antoine Harispuru, (better known as Golden Bug) with Barcelona art studio Desilence. This is a show that draws its initial inspiration from the famous Rubik Snake game (primarily its triangular structures) and in which parsimonious techno is mixed with organic visual and retro-futuristic mappings. The resulting work from these renowned and talented creators is a unique musical and visual experience that can be enjoyed on Friday 17, in the SonarComplex auditorium (Sónar by Day).

Harispuru is a man of many interests and talents. Producer, remixer and La Belle label owner, the Frenchman –resident in Barcelona for several years- grew up in Paris surrounded by rudimentary instruments and accompanied by a robot called V.I.C.T.O.R. (the name he has given to his latest project). His music under the Golden Bug pseudonym -with a sound leaning towards disco- has been released on labels including Gomma and Bang Gang, receiving support from the likes of Erol Alkan, Andrew Weatherall and Prins Thomas among others. Meanwhile, Desilence is one of the most active visual artist teams in Barcelona, ​​formed by Tatiana Halbach and Søren Christensen. Both have spent more than a decade working in fields such as music, theatre and fashion without ever restricting the confines of their work and constantly renewing its aesthetical discourse.
