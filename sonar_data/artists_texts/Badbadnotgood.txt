Badbadnotgood
Off road jazz combo
Formed in Toronto in 2011, the extremely gifted and versatile musicians of BBNG; Matthew Tavares (keyboards), Chester Hansen (bass) and Alex Sowinski (drums), have from the outset moved seamlessly between genres, aiming to break down the barriers between them. They accomplish this with considerable ease on albums such as "III", a muscular instrumental workout, and especially on "Sour Soul" - the outstanding jazz-funk-rap album recorded last year with the indefatigable Ghostface Killah - that shows off to the full the incredible musical bond between the band members. The band have also collaborated with other heavyweight hip-hop producers including DOOM, and more recently paid their respects to another integral figure in contemporary electronic music, James Blake, with two incredible cover versions of his tracks, "CMYK" and "Limit To Your Love". As of January 2016 they have expanded from a trio to form a quartet, being joined by saxophonist Leland Whitty.

Hip-hop has always been at the centre of the Canadian jazzmenâ€™s musical obsessions and they do not shy away from sampling classic bass lines from the genre, as seen on the LP "BBNG" and the EP "BBNG2" (both self-released). As proof of their deep knowlege and love for the genre, they have collaborated with artists including Frank Ocean, Tyler The Creator, Danny Brown, Earl Sweatshirt, RZA and the great Bootsy Collins (among others); providing a full-bodied yet flexible instrumental backdrop for their accomplices in the studio. While Badbadnotgood begin with jazz and have hip-hop as their ostensible destination, they touch upon everything along the way, from funk, post-punk and African rhythms to dance music.
