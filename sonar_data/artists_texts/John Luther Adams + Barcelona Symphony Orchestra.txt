John Luther Adams + Barcelona Symphony Orchestra
Sónar and L’Auditori
Sónar and Barcelona’s Auditori reignite their collaboration to jointly present "Become Ocean", an orchestral composition by John Luther Adams directed by Brad Lubman and performed by the Barcelona and Catalonia National Symphony Orchestra (OBC).

"Become Ocean" positions itself halfway between symphony and contemporary ambient, moving the aesthetic and sound of electronic drones, to a symphonic orchestral language. The 42-minute piece is inspired by the mass of the Pacific Ocean and warns us about the progressive melting of the Arctic as a result of global warming. "Become Ocean" was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2014 and the Grammy for Best Contemporary Composition in 2015 and has been heralded as a work destined to break new ground for symphonic writing in the XXI century. Renowned New Yorker critic Alex Ross -author of "The Eternal Noise"- defined the piece thus: "It may be the loveliest apocalypse in musical history."
