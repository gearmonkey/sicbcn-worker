Nicola Cruz
The Andean tradition revisited
Nicola Cruzâ€™s work has a clear direction and a specific source: the Ecuadorian Andes, where his roots can be traced. Although born in Limoges, France, Cruz lives and works in Quito, and much of his inspiration comes from the landscape, folklore and instrumentation characterized by the enormous mountain range and Amazon rainforest. Cruz incorporates past myths and sounds, revamping them using current production techniques and adding seductive electronic textures. All this is perfectly embodied by his debut album, "Prender el Alma", which he will present live on the SonarHall stage.

Cruz began his career as a percussionist, but quickly became fascinated with electronica. His music is an original blend of tradition and technology, open exploration of large landscapes and an intimate and personal examination. His sound and style are also shaped by his previous work in the area of sound installations, field recordings and soundtrack composition. In 2011 he collaborated with Nicolas Jaar on his label, Clown & Sunset, which opened doors to a wider audience in the United States, where he performed at emblematic venues like the PS1 in New York (MoMA headquarters in Queens) and the Echoplex in Los Angeles.
