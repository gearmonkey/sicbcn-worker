LiL JaBBA
Volcanic Rhythms
Brooklyn-residing producer LiL JaBBA was inspired to get into the studio by the late great DJ Rashad. The influence is still clear today in his rapid-fire sampling, but it’s the weird viscerality of LiL JaBBA that makes him stand out. After self-releasing tapes of his music in Baltimore, LiL JaBBA has since released on underground labels Local Action, True Panther and Watercolor, and contributed to a radical new kind of club music that speaks to what it’s like to grow up on the internet. In his own words, his new album, due in 2015, sounds like “garage that’s fallen into a bubbling, percolating volcano.”
