Sobrenadar
Dreamy electronics
A studied music producer, Paula Soledad Garcia is doing whatever it takes to stay afloat as a musician in Buenos Aires. Besides making supremely dreamy, Cocteau Twins-inspired synth pop as Sobrenadar, she also composes music for short films and advertisements, teaches classes, and works as composer and assistant in recording studios. Lately her main project has been picking up steam, and Paula says that she feels fortunate to be playing a lot and traveling to other countries.
