James Rhodes
Music saves lives
"In my concerts I talk about the pieces I play, I explain why I have chosen each, how important they are to me and the context in which they where composed." This is how James Rhodes explains his performances in the preface to his book "Instrumental”, A Memoir of Madness, Medication and Music", for which he has earned a huge and unexpected worldwide success. Besides playing, and placing in context, pieces by Bach, Rachmaninov, Schubert and Beethoven, the British pianist also tells the story of his life (abuse, addictions and asylums) and how music has helped him overcome the many severe obstacles in his life.

Rhodes is a classical music lover, to the point where he begins "Instrumental" with the phrase "Classical music turns me on". Charismatic, visceral and very talented, Rhodes says Bach (and specifically "The Goldberg Variations") saved his life, and he is not exaggerating. At 40 years old he has become a leading figure in popularizing classical music worldwide, thanks to tours and concerts at all kinds of festivals and venues, as well as various British TV documentaries filmed with his approval. His presence at Sónar by Day is irrefutable evidence that, effectively, music can heal.
