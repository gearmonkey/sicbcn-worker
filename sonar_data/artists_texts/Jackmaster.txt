Jackmaster
Superstar DJ
In the five years that have passed since his last Sónar performance, Jack Revill has established himself as one of the finest and most admired dj’s in the world. A product of the underground, his independent spirit remains intact, while he is equally at home sharing centre stage with the likes of Jamie Jones and Seth Troxler in Ibiza. His lack of musical prejudice, an open-minded approach and ability to adapt to any given situation are just some of the reasons why year after year he has retained his popularity with the masses. An equally important factor is his wide-ranging taste, and ability to surprise: something that makes it impossible to know for certain which musical direction his sets will take. It is also worth pointing out that Jackmaster is one of a handful of djs on the international scene who has remained at the top without the need to produce or remix, relying almost exclusively on his innate skills and talent on the decks to thrive.

Jackmaster has been obsessed with music ever since his early years working at the legendary record store Rubadub in his native Glasgow, a place he continues to cite as the source and starting point for his unmatched sound. Self confessed super fan of Prince and dedicated collector of disco and funk gems and rarities, Revill was involved in collectives and labels like Dress 2 Sweat and Wireblock before founding Numbers with his friend Spencer. The label has released material, SBTRKT, Deadboy, Redinho, Jessie Ware, Sophie, Jamie xx and Mosca among many others. Since the very beginning his sets have been a object lesson in versatility and imagination; as can be seen on the now infamous mix series ‘Tweak-A-Holic’, his many contributions to websites, clubs and benchmark music platforms (Essential Mix, Fact, Resident Advisor, Fabric) and, of course, countless sets at festivals around the world. No other dj combines passion, knowledge, energy, honesty and humour better than Jackmaster.
