Gerd Janson
DJ Excellence
Gerd Janson is the original Endor blender, touched with the ability to unearth treasured discs that make music lovers’ eyebrows arch and hips dip. He is one of modern house music’s most accomplished DJs, having held long residencies at two of the world’s most revered nightclubs, Robert Johnson in Frankfurt and Berghain/Panorama Bar in Berlin. His encyclopedic knowledge of house music history, coupled with a resolutely contemporary ear, has made his DJ sets essential listening over the past decade, while he’s continued putting out releases by the likes of Move D, Maurice Fulton, Radio Slave, Theo Parrish, Tensnake and many more via his own unclassifiable record label Running Back. A member of the Tuff City Kids production duo with Philip Lauer, a former writer for Groove and Spex and a longtime Red Bull Music Academy team member, there’s a special pride that goes along with seeing the rest of the world find out what we knew all along: Gerd is one of the best DJs in the game, reconfiguring classics in unexpected ways while also creating classics of his own, years before everyone else plays them out.
