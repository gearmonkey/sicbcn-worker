Lafawndah
Global vision
Paris-based singer/producer Yasmine Dubois has been causing ripples worldwide with her futuristic take on globaltronica as Lafawndah. After packing in her job as a gallery curator in New York, the half-Iranian, half-Egyptian musician moved back to Paris to concentrate on honing her “ritual club music,” influenced by Nina Simone, Brandy, traditional Middle Eastern singers, dancehall queens and the Night Slugs label’s modernist take on grime and bass. For her self titled debut Lafawndah flew to Guadeloupe to work with Portuguese producer Garagem Banda, Emily King, and zouk veteran Jean Claude Bichara. A nod, perhaps, to Grace Jones, the result is what she calls “island life music,” a sensual synthesis of industrial, drone, ’80s electronic bands and tropical flourishes. Collaboration is where her heart lies, and she’s since worked with producers like L-Vis 1990, Bruno Coviello and Nick Weiss. Her ’Tan’ EP was released to much fanfare by Warp Records earlier this year.
