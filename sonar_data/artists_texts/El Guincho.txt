El Guincho
HiperMusic
Allergic to stagnation and revisiting old ideas, Pablo Diaz-Reixa has added another twist to his sound with El Guincho’s new album "HiperAsia". The album was inspired by a Chinese superstore of the same name located in the outskirts of Madrid, where all kinds of products are mixed together in a huge unending space. A similar claim can be made of the album: Broken beats, oblique sounds and sophisticated melodies mixed with his own voice, modulated in a thousand different ways, and a feature by Spanish rapper 'La Mala Rodriguez with onthe first single, "Comix", featuring Mala Rodriguez. While El Guincho retains his catchy pop aesthetic and his unusual incomparable talent for weaving words and sounds,  however his new album is markedly different from his much lauded early work inthe much celebrated "Alegranza" and "Pop NegroBlack". Diaz-Reixa will present his new songs live (at SonarVillage, Friday 19) supported by several backing musicians and a host of samplers, synthesizers and drum machines, plus a bass and lead guitar passing through multiple filters.

The musician and producer from the Canary Islands ies took his first steps into the music world while living in Barcelona. He played drums in the band Coconot and was part of underground projects such as La Orquesta de la Muerte and Dead Man On Campus. In 2006 he released "Folias", his first work as El Guincho, but received much wider recognition a year later for "Alegranza", one of the most innovative and remarkable records made in Spain overSpanish records of the last decade. Its impact was extraordinary, receiving plaudits across the globe. His second album, "Pop NegroBlack", released on British label Young Turks in 2010, once again garnered worldwide acclaim. His list of achievements also includes collaborating with Björk (inn the "Biophilia" era); productions for Los Punsetes and Extraperlo; and the "Trances" EP released last year on Hivern Disc.
