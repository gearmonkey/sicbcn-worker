Kaytranada
Silken Beats
With rhythms and beats that would turn even the mighty J Dilla green with envy, an exquisite soulful touch for melodies, and a healthy dose of funk in his bass lines, Kaytranada is one of today's best producers, working in a broad sound spectrum including house, hip-hop, R&B and funk, the four integral elements of his style. '99.9%', his new album, featuring collaborations from BadBadNotGood, Syd Tha Kid, Karriem Riggins, Anderson .Paak y Little Dragon among others, is a further testament to his talent; as will be his performance on Sat June 18th at SÃ³nar by Night, directly after Santigold.

If his first visit to the festival in 2014 signified his emergence as a beatmaker of the future, he is now a fully fledged producer, who has lent his innate talent and skills to singers and artists including Rome Fortune, Katy B, Craig David, The Internet, Freddie Gibbs and Talib Kweli and many others. Kaytranada (Kevin Celestin) was born in Haiti and raised in Montreal. In his teens he absorbed everything related to hip-hop and R&B culture, to the extent that between the age of 15 to 17 he was successfully-producing at least one beat per day. It was not long before his mix tapes and edits (Missy Elliot, Janet Jackson, TLC or Danny Brown among others) drew attention from labels like Bromance, HW&W and Jakarta, on which he has released some of his excellent material.
