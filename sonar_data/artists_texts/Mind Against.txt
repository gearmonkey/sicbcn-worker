Mind Against
Spiralling progression
Brothers Alessandro and Federico Fognini have for some time now been cornerstones of the Italian label Life & Death, to the extent that they are currently involved in its management and the search for new artists. Berlin residents - and part of a loose scene of European producers that include their good friends Tale Of Us -, the duo have carved out their own hotly contested space in the city, playing at the intersection between IDM, house and techno. Their precise and penetrating sound will lead the way on Friday night, before Richie Hawtin's performance at SonarClub.

The name Mind Against began at Sónar and received early critical acclaim in 2014 thanks to a trio of EPs on Life & Death, “Atlant”, “Avalon” and “Strange Days” as well as remixes for Róisín Murphy and WhoMadeWho. Last year they briefly betrayed the label (so to speak) recording an album together with Locked Groove for Hotflush (the label managed by Scuba). They then returned home with the release of two shared EPs, one with the Milanese producer Somne, and the more recent “Astral” with their regular partners in crime, Tale Of Us. Over the last year they have taken a major leap forward, becoming increasingly popular, it is therefore the perfect opportunity to see them perform at Sónar before their careers go stratospheric.
