Alizzz
Neon beats
Extremely well known in Barcelona and on the national dance music circuit, last year the talented Cristian Quirante also began to win over European and American audiences. Hardly surprising when his mastery when combining futuristic r&b, indie pop and dance music is more than worthy of all the praise and success that has enjoyed since he first began as Alizzz in 2013. His work rate during this time has been nothing short of frenetic, with 3 EPs in 3 years (the latest, "Sunshine" was released on Jeffree's, a sister label to Diplo’s Mad Decent) and countless remixes and edits spread across several platforms. His song "Your Love" featured the voice of Max Marshall and rose quickly in last year’s Spotify charts, achieving over half a million worldwide listeners. He is currently working on a new EP, due for imminent release, and several remixes that will appear throughout 2016. His set at this year’s Sónar by Night will open the SonarPub stage on Saturday night, before the Santigold concert.

Formally recording as Pisu, on the label Música Vermella, with his new alias Alizzz, Quirante has discovered his very own sound, leading him to tour throughout the United States, Australia and Japan. His tracks have received support from today’s foremost electronic luminaries including Ryan Hemsworth, Baauer, Canblaster and collectives like Diplo and Mad Decent, Fool's Gold and LuckyMe. His "Whoa" EP on Galician label Arkestra in 2013, remains one of the most important albums released in Spain this decade. His polished infectious beats work equally well on the dance floor as in the charts. They are also the perfect platform for all kinds of MC’s to rhyme freely over.
