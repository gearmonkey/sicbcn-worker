Congo Natty feat. Congo Dubz, Tenor Fly, Nãnci & Phoebe
Jungle Vibez
What better place than SonarVillage to enjoy the very best in jungle and reggae from one of its seasoned pros: Congo Natty. With a long and established career behind him, British born Michael West -Natty- (aka Rebel MC and Conquering Lion) is once again making waves thanks to the album "Jungle Revolution", released on Ninja Tune imprint Big Dada. The unadulterated Jamaican flavour of the Jungle LP was mixed by dub magician Adrian Sherwood and features many renowned guests, several of whom will accompany him live on stage at Sónar: Right hand man Congo Dubz; mythical toaster Tenor Fly; and Nãnci Correia and Phoebe Hibbert, vocalists from London duo Irondread. This all-star British drum'n'bass and ragga team will guarantee nonstop dancing and jubilation on the grass at Sónar by Day.

West became widely known through his Rebel MC alias and formed part of the 80s electro-ragga quartet Double Trouble, with whom he broke into the charts thanks to the hit "Tuff City". Soon afterwards he began his solo career which saw him move away from hip-hop towards reggae, dancehall, dub, and above all, the 100% British genre jungle. With a style heavily indebted to his Jamaican roots, these are clearly visible in the titles of his first two albums: "Tribute to Haile Selassie I" (2000) and "Lion In The Jungle" (2001). For this new outing Congo Natty collaborated with some of the genre’s top artists, bringing together the best MCs and vocalists of his generation, including Barrington Levy, Tenor Fly and Dennis Brown. His latest release, the "Jungle Revolution" remix album also includes new DJs and producers including Dj Madd, Sukh Knight and Mungos Hi-Fi, as well as battle-hardened masters like Adrian Sherwood. It is a real treat to have him appear at Sónar.
