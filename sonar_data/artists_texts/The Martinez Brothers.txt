The Martinez Brothers
House is a family thing
New York nightlife’s most infamous brothers will close one of the most important areas of the festival: Friday night at SonarClub, the main stage at Sónar by Night. To be bestowed with such an honour (and responsibility) does not happen by chance: Chris and Steve Jr. Martinez have already amassed years of experience making people dance and their excellence and adaptability to any given situation is guaranteed. They are equally adept at rocking a small basement club crowd in Brooklyn or 20,000 people at a large festival. Right now they are among the few DJs in the world capable of balancing the essence of the underground with an accessibility that attracts all types of audiences.

The Martinez brothers have achieved this rare prominence after many years of hard work. They began with secret raves in their native Bronx, later conquering the rest of the city, while gradually expanding their popularity at major nights in both Ibiza and Berlin. In recent years they have collaborated with the crème de la crème of house music and international techno; From Soul Clap and Seth Troxler, to working with Nile Rodgers on one of his latest tracks. They've also recorded a session for the legendary BBC Essential Mix and have released their own material -mostly in mixtape format- for free download. This work includes two volumes of 'Warhol*Basquiat', a humorous riff on the excesses of the today’s art market, and "The Masters Collection Vol.1" entitled Masters At Dutch. They are deservedly regarded as the new ambassadors of the New York house scene, following in the footsteps of giants like Todd Terry, Larry Levan, Kerri Chandler and Masters At Work.
