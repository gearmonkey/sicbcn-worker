DVS1 & Rødhåd
Techno squared
Bringing the proceedings to a close at the SonarLab stage on Friday night, Resident Advisor presents an exciting duel between two masters of techno: The American DVS1 (pronounced “devious one”) along with Berlin's Rødhåd. Although hailing from different scenes and generations, they both share the same approach to producing and DJing, where energy, complexity and depth are the primary components of their sound. There is another detail that can be applied equally to both: the quintessential technique that allows them to mix any track from any spectrum of techno, dub or house with great fluency and imagination, fully focused on the dance floor.

Zak Khutoretsky, aka DVS1, is a central figure of American underground techno, from taking his first steps in Midwest raves and New York acid house nights in the early '90s, to today, where he travels around the world as one of Berlin’s Berghain resident DJs. Of Russian descent, Khutoretsky homes in on the powerful, physical side of techno , both in his sets and on EPs released on Klockworks (Ben Klock), Transmat (Derrick May) or his own imprints Hush and Mistress Recordings. Rødhåd also cut his teeth at illegal parties, in his case Berlin in the late 90s, and has slowly been establishing himself as one of the most tenacious techno artists to emerge from the German capital, mixing -both in his sets and productions- techno-dub with dry percussion and digital grooves. In 2009 he began his dystopian nights at the Arena Club in the Kreuzberg district, and in 2012 founded his label under the same name, which has released much of his excellent material to date.
