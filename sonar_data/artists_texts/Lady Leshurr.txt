Lady Leshurr
The new Queen speaks
When a Youtube video reaches twenty million views it usually means something special. This is the number of plays achieved by Lady Leshurr’s "Queens Speech # 4" a video posted in July 2015. The latest video instalment “number 5” has already been viewed more than five million times (and rapidly counting) in just one month. The super fresh English MC has become a phenomenon with her rapid-fire freestyle raps fused with self produced grime and hip-hop in collaboration with newcomers like Show & Prove, Krunchie and Z Dot. The UK sound’s new queen will offer large doses of relentless rhymes (and beats) and remarkable charisma, on stage at SonarVillage. Haling from the Kingshurts suburb, ten minutes from Birmingham, Melesha O'Garro is blessed with amazing talent and knowledge. So far this decade she has already released nearly a dozen mixtapes and four EPs, has launched her own label (Gutter Strut), in record has achieved viral numbers on the web with her Queens Speech series (recently compiled on one disc) and has worked with various producers and artists (including Stormzy, and France's Mr. Flash from the Ed Banger stable). A few weeks ago she uploaded a rereading of Kanye West’s "Real Friends" to her Soundcloud account and at the end of 2015 she performed cover versions of classic songs by Sister Nancy, Missy Elliott, Drake and Eminem for BBC 1Xtra Live. One word to sum her up? Attitude.
