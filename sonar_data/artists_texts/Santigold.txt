Santigold
A triumphant comeback
After four long years of anticipation Santigold is back with a new album "99¢", following her previous work "Master Of My Make Believe" in 2012. In recent interviews she has explained how hard she had been working during this period, and listening to her new album it is abundantly clear that the effort was more than worthwhile. Two perfect examples already in circulation as early singles are: the vibrant "Can’t Get Enough Of Myself", characteristically flawless pop drawing from funk, hip-hop and reggae; and "Who Be Lovin Me", a magnetic mid tempo trap which sees her collaborate with ILoveMakonnen on the mic, and whose video included appearances from A-Trak, De La Soul, DJ Mustard and Earl Sweatshirt, among others. On "99¢" the Philadelphia artist critically but humorously reflects on the obsession with perfection and the commercial nature of our lives, discernible from the title and the cover art by Japanese photographer Haruhiko Kawaguchi. The momentous return of Santigold will be served in double helpings: Friday at Sónar by Day (SonarVillage) and Saturday at Sónar by Night (SonarPub).

A songwriter, producer and singer with an extensive catalogue, Santi White drew worldwide attention with her first single in 2007 under the pseudonym Santogold. Following her critically acclaimed debut album –much lauded for its originality and fusion of genres and styles- came her second album, "Master of My Make Believe" which reached the top of the charts, winning all sorts of awards and nominations, despite its deeper and darker nature. Always artistically true to herself and in a constant state of flux, Santigold has collaborated with producers and artists like Diplo, Switch, Dave Sitek of TV On The Radio fame (who returns to add production to"99 ¢"), MIA, Jay-Z, The Streets and Beastie Boys. Her songs including “LES Artistes”, “Disparate Youth” or “Go!” are mainstays on radio, club, and dj playlists all over the world.
