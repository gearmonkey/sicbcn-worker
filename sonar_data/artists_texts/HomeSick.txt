HomeSick
Footwork jungle
If all you knew about HomeSick was the name of his blog, you’d have a pretty good idea of the music he makes. That name? Footwork-Jungle. The Calgary-based producer loves energetic music, wherever it comes from. In most cases, that means the internet: the place that he counts as the most inspirational in his creative life. As well as running his Footwork-Jungle blog, Homesick is a net artist who, IRL, runs a footwork night in Calgary called Percolate, is an adept jazz keyboardist, and harbours a deep love of fusion –there’s that love of speed, again– but when he’s producing his own music, it’s all about up-to-the-minute bass mutations from Chicago and the UK.
