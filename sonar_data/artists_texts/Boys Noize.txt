Boys Noize
World premiere
Alex Ridha, better known as Boys Noize, will present the worldwide premiere of his new show at Sónar Barcelona. Ten years after his first steps towards the international stage, the german producer conceived a new live spectacle together with visual artists Sus Boy and Lil Internet, exploring a focused thematic narrative with visual and scenic elements inspired by cyberpunk, 80's industrial, surveillance in contemporary society and the light, dark and greys of the struggle between humans and technology. The new show is closely linked to the presentation of his recently released fourth LP ‘Mayday’, featuring collaborations from Hudson Mohawke, Poliça, Spank Rock and Benga, among others. The album further consolidates Boys Noize’s signature sound - a blend of acid, banging techno and euphoric electro that he’s renowned for.

He has collaborated with Chilly Gonzales, Snoop Dogg, Santigold and Tiga, remixed Daft Punk, Depeche Mode and Nine Inch Nails, contributed to Oliver Stone's Snowden film soundtrack, formed the Dog Blood duo together with Skrillex, and much more. He celebrated his label´s 100th release with remixes by Chemical Brothers and Justice, and marked the 10th anniversary of Boysnoize Records last year. With over 150 acclaimed releases that have become DJ set staples of both big rooms and basements, his Berlin based imprint has formed a league of its own including artists such as Djedjotronic, Siriusmo, SCNTST, Peaches, Spank Rock, Hoshina Anniversary and Cardopusher. 2ManyDJ's have said "Boys Noize is the only DJ who can play underground techno for 30,000 people." If you don't believe them, you can see for yourself at Boys Noize's 2016 Sonar live show debut. The equation is simple: Sónar by Night + Boys Noize = Fire.
