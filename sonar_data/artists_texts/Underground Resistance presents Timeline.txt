Underground Resistance presents Timeline
Detroit’s legacy
Led by Underground Resistance founding member, Academy studio tutor and all-around badman ‘Mad’ Mike Banks, Timeline is the live band that’s keeping the name of the Detroit techno pioneers alive on the stages of this planet. Banks on keys is joined by Jon Dixon and De’Sean Jones of Galaxy 2 Galaxy on sax and more keys, plus DJ/producer Mark Flash, combining for a potent amalgam of jazz, house and true-school Motor City techno. Underground Resistance have been synonymous with uncompromising electronic music since the collective’s inception, and the Timeline project is an ongoing extension of their mission to further the legacy — and expand the definition — of black music from Detroit.
