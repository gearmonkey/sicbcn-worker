Hard beats
Evan Sutton (also known as Astrolith) is a producer and engineer based in New York City. Aside from being a first call production whiz for artists like Vince Clarke (of Erasure and Depeche Mode) and Daniel Platzman (of Imagine Dragons), he is an in-demand remixer, recently working with Imagine Dragons, Spank Rock, and X Ambassadors to name a few.
