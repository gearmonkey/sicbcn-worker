Lemonick
Alpine grime
Lemonick is the project of half-Scottish, half-Swiss producer and DJ, Nicolas Baillie. Part of local Swiss crew Kartel Klub –a collective of nine DJs, producers and label owners that has held residencies at clubs throughout the country– he presents their monthly podcast Kartel Kast, as well as presenting a show on Swiss alternative radio station Couleur 3. Meanwhile, his productions –with their choked basslines, clobbering drums, and peppering of gunshot samples– reference up-to-the-minute UK dance music.
