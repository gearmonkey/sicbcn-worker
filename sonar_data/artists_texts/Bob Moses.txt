In search of the perfect electronic song
Born and raised in Canada but now working from New York, the duo comprised of Tom Howie and Jimmy Vallance operate at the intersection where silky contemporary electronica meets classic pop composition. In fact their songs uncover the myriad of possibilities that exist when combining these elements. Their debut album, "Days Gone By", released on Domino in September 2015, draws from their continual quest for perfection, both in rhythm (r&b, house, electronica and impeccable production) and the lyrical use of vocals. Their synth pop delights are at times reminiscent of Hot Chip at their most poetic, or outstanding bands like Metronomy, Chromatics and other renowned Canadian band Junior Boys –their sound is also not a million miles away from that of James Blake-. Their concert will therefore be perfectly placed under the sunshine, on the grass in the magical atmosphere of SónarVillage, the main stage at Sónar by Day.

Vallance and Howie met at the Vancouver School of Art, but it was not until several years later following a chance encounter that led to their joint project. Their medium paced sophisticated and captivating house music quickly caught the attention of Brooklyn label Scissor & Thread, whose like minded artists include Black Light Smoke and Frank & Tony. The label released their first two EPs, "Hands To Hold" and "Far From The Tree" with which they began to win over their first fan base and saw their subsequent move to prominent label Domino. Their music effortlessly captures the contrast between the nocturnal euphoria and melancholia of the big city.
