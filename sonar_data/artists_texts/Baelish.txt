Baelish
Floating synths
Baelish is the new project from Barcelona based producer Carlos Guinart, which momentarily sees him move away from the sounds of bass and electronic dance music, that for several years he has cultivated via his Check One alias. For this new adventure, Guinart will arrive at Sónar laden with spatial synthesizers, cosmic pianos, slowed down rhythms and floating atmospheres that draw on dystopian and wide-open soundscapes. These concepts are clearly demonstrated on “New Era”, the first EP released on the Catalan Molts Records label, to which he has been affiliated since its inception. Baelish will play six songs from the EP live at SonarVillage, on Thursday 16th June, which will be his first concert of 2016.

Guinart is not new to music production. His best-known work to date was produced under his Check One pseudonym, which saw him experiment with his passion for styles including hip hop, dancehall, dubstep and funk. His EP "Scherbe” was released on German label Dub Bullet Rec. in 2008, and his performance at Sónar that same year were pivotal points in his career and also confirmed his status as one of dubstep’s pioneers. Until now his sound has been characterized by the forceful nature of his rhythms and bass lines, with a danceable element as a common denominator. As Baelish, a ‘new era’ is indeed born, which also relates to the birth of his first daughter.
