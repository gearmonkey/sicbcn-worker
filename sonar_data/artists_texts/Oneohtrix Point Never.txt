Oneohtrix Point Never
Where anything is possible
Pushing things forward, behind the strange and incomparable Oneohtrix Point Never moniker is Daniel Lopatin. Following the superb "R Plus Seven" in 2013, the Russian-born American producer more recently released "Garden of Delete", his second album for Warp, an even more ambitious affair than its predecessor. And as if that were not enough, he will also form part of the Anohni project, along with Antony Hegarty and Hudson Mohawke, whose performance together at Sónar by Night will most definitely be one of this year’s highlights. As is typical of his music, "Garden of Delete" provides seemingly impossible sounds: new age passages, convoluted digital processes, his own black metal and grunge riffs (he recently toured with Soundgarden and Nine Inch Nails), r&b beats, noise bursts and delicate string chords. Lopatin, who has recently recorded a full album with Teklife's DJ Earl, will touch down at Sónar armed with a multimedia show created by visual artist Nate Boyce.

The son of Russian immigrants, Lopatin started Oneohtrix Point Never in order to explore the sounds of his childhood and adolescence, moving into the realm of digital creation and visionary electronica. Among his arsenal of instruments, perhaps the most important is his father’s antiquated synthesizer, which he has used in most of his works in tandem with his boundless imagination. Although he had already recorded a handful of albums between 2007 and 2009 (partially represented by the compilation "Rifts"), his music began to receive recognition after "Returnal", released in 2010 by Editions Mego, and later through two fundamental pieces of contemporary electronica; "Replica" (released on his own label, Software Records in 2011) and "R Plus Seven" on Warp. "Garden of Delete" adds yet another notch to a discography that is undoubtedly one of the most original corpuses of expansive and stimulating works in recent years.
