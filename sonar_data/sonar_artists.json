The band are responsible for the music for \"No Man's Sky\", the latest spectacular PlayStation\u00ae4 game, and their new live show will showcase the game's infinite soundtrack generated in procedural audio form. The Sheffield group have been commissioned to compose and perform the game's score using their distinctive, absorbent and expansive sound, which fits perfectly with the aesthetic of the giant space epic \"No Man's Sky\". The game has already won several awards and is one of 2016's most anticipated releases.\r\n\r\n65daysofstatic formed in Sheffield in 2001 and have since released six instrumental music albums and multiple EPs, effortlessly moving between various genres (post-rock, jazz, electronica) using noise as an essential element. The quartet currently consists of Robert Jones (drums), Joe Shrewsbury (guitars), Paul Wolinski (piano, guitar, programming) and Simon Wright (bass, synthesizer). They have developed a unique sound adaptable to any given situation and location, from northern European clubs to American road bars, Siberian stores, British museums or Australian jungles. Among the many projects they have been involved with it is worth mentioning: their online remixes in real time (under the name Prisms); an infinite duration piece made on an open-source platform; adaptations of works for dance and television (BBC); and an experimental short film, \"Oscillator\", which they also directed."},

The result is one of the most exciting fusions of global electronic dance sounds that can be heard today; modern, intoxicating, and powerfully evocative music. Just take a look at any of thier videos on YouTube, watch their sets (e.g. the excellent mix for French magazine Tsugi) or listen to the recent \"Djazirat el Maghreb EP\" and fall under the spell of a sound that combines the best dance sounds from both Eastern and Western cultures.\r\n\r\nIt all started when Minisky and Carvalho -both experienced club DJs and residents at Paris\u2019s Chez Moune- travelled to Tunisia together with another key name of French electronica, dj Gilb'R. Fascinated by what they heard they began to experiment with these sounds, sharing their discoveries with other like-minded producers and musicians, who were invited to join the project. Henceforth came the singles and the subsequent compilation \"Acid Arab Collections\" a high tide mark of today\u2019s Arab Acid project, which included the participation of among others Crackboy (remixing Omar Souleyman), Pilooski, Etienne Jaumet and I: Cube. Since then, and with the support of label Versatile (run by Gilb'R), the Parisian duo has continued to explore their exquisite combination of acid and Maghreb music (and beyond: Kurdistan, Pakistan, India) in dj sessions, remixes and EPs, to a powerful and addictive effect."},

Hardly surprising when his mastery when combining futuristic r&b, indie pop and dance music is more than worthy of all the praise and success that has enjoyed since he first began as Alizzz in 2013. His work rate during this time has been nothing short of frenetic, with 3 EPs in 3 years (the latest, \"Sunshine\" was released on Jeffree's, a sister label to Diplo\u2019s Mad Decent) and countless remixes and edits spread across several platforms. His song \"Your Love\" featured the voice of Max Marshall and rose quickly in last year\u2019s Spotify charts, achieving over half a million worldwide listeners. He is currently working on a new EP, due for imminent release, and several remixes that will appear throughout 2016. His set at this year\u2019s S\u00f3nar by Night will open the SonarPub stage on Saturday night, before the Santigold concert.\r\n\r\nFormally recording as Pisu, on the label M\u00fasica Vermella, with his new alias Alizzz, Quirante has discovered his very own sound, leading him to tour throughout the United States, Australia and Japan. His tracks have received support from today\u2019s foremost electronic luminaries including Ryan Hemsworth, Baauer, Canblaster and collectives like Diplo and Mad Decent, Fool's Gold and LuckyMe. His \"Whoa\" EP on Galician label Arkestra in 2013, remains one of the most important albums released in Spain this decade. His polished infectious beats work equally well on the dance floor as in the charts. They are also the perfect platform for all kinds of MC\u2019s to rhyme freely over."},

In April last year the German artist released \"Xerrox Vol. 3\", the last in a series of albums that incorporates the name of his self-designed composition software. The album was inspired by very personal influences, such as Jules Verne or the soundtrack of \"Solaris\" by Andrei Tarkovsky. This opened the door to emotions associated with nostalgia and Noto\u2019s own memories, which can be heard in his archetypally mathematical electronic music and dynamic soundscapes. Most recently, he collaborated with Ryuichi Sakamoto on the soundtrack for \"The Revenant\", the film by Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez-I\u00f1arritu, which has just received 12 nominations for the 2016 Oscars.\r\n\r\nBehind the Alva Noto moniker we find Carsten Nicolai, one of the most important sound explorers of our time. A student of Architecture in his formative years and a visual artist always interested in the physical qualities of sound, Nicolai has worked on many projects, both on his own and with other artists including: Ryuichi Sakamoto, Bretschneider (Signal), Bender (Diamond Version), Blixa Bargeld (NBBA) and Ryoji Ikeda (Cyclo), among many others. S\u00f3nar has had the honour of hosting several of his projects over the years, among them the large digital installation 'Unidisplay', a work that featured in the first edition of S\u00f3narPlanta. Nicolai is permanently in a state of flux and will give us a taste of his new Alva Noto material via one of his scientifically precise audiovisual shows that will further demonstrate his growing interest in dance music rhythms."},

As expected, the western world responded more than enthusiastically: everyone who hears \"Obaa Sima\" for the first time is instantly hooked by its simple rhythms, frenetic raps and originality. Fact Magazine, an important online music trends website, proclaimed it the most important reissue of 2015, and reviews have been unanimously positive in all major media across America and Europe. More than twenty years on from the album\u2019s first recording, Ata Kak will now come to Europe to present his amazing songs at SonarVillage, where a party vibe is guaranteed.\r\n\r\nAta Kak\u2019s history is a curious one. In 94 he released an album on cassette format called \"Obaa Sima\", which at the time virtually no one listened to. It was soon buried beneath a plethora of other tapes and records being sold in Ghana\u2019s major city markets. However, eight years later, one of these tapes caught the attention of a young New York ethnomusicologist, Brian Shimkovitz, who was fascinated by the strange mix of highlife (a celebratory African genre close to funk) and Western style rap. That tape, and one track in particular, \"Moma Yendolo\" would give rise to Awesome Tapes From Africa, the popular blog where Shimkovitz would post the best tapes he had bought during his travels to the continent, which later became a key label in the dissemination of African sounds. In fact Shimkovitz partly created the label to officially release \"Obaa Sima\", and share with the world this exciting, addictive and intoxicating music that we will soon enjoy on the green grass at S\u00f3nar by Day."},

Following his two most recent and essential LPs signed under the Byetone pseudonym, and the Diamond Version alias (another project with Nicolai), Bender is now working on new material, so far without a title or an official release date. However, some of this may well be aired as part of the raster-noton 20-year Anniversary showcase at S\u00f3nar.\r\n\r\nA cult figure in Berlin IDM and minimal techno circles, Bender first caused a stir in 2008 with the release of \"Plastic Star\" followed immediately by the album \"Death of a Typographer\". Both releases breathed new life into the label\u2019s electronic clicks and cuts, thanks to the introduction of powerful 4x4 bass drums and their own unique brand of club music and rhythmic patterns; developments that do not take away from the basic identity of the label, but delved further into ideas of expression and hypnotic effects. The penetrating and powerful sound of \"Death...\" was repeated on the follow up album \"Symeta\" released in 2011. Its live adaptation saw a series of extraordinary concerts that showcased the precise synchronization between image and sound, fundamental characteristics in all raster-noton shows, led by its finest exponent Byetone."},

The Catalan musician continues to search for the perfect balance between emotion, experimentation and dance, both as a producer, live performer (he is an experienced violin player) and through his dj sets. These elements are clearly audible in his releases as C156 (a collaborative project with Headbirds, Dr. Res and The Gardener) and the excellent EPs \"Awakening\" and \"35/8\", both tracks which happily reappear on his highly anticipated debut album."},

Soon afterwards he began his solo career which saw him move away from hip-hop towards reggae, dancehall, dub, and above all, the 100% British genre jungle. With a style heavily indebted to his Jamaican roots, these are clearly visible in the titles of his first two albums: \"Tribute to Haile Selassie I\" (2000) and \"Lion In The Jungle\" (2001). For this new outing Congo Natty collaborated with some of the genre\u2019s top artists, bringing together the best MCs and vocalists of his generation, including Barrington Levy, Tenor Fly and Dennis Brown. His latest release, the \"Jungle Revolution\" remix album also includes new DJs and producers including Dj Madd, Sukh Knight and Mungos Hi-Fi, as well as battle-hardened masters like Adrian Sherwood.

More than just concerts, Nicolai and Ikeda will put forward highly technological sensory impacting shows affecting retinas and eardrums that mix repetitive algorithmic techno with powerful visual interpretations of their sound.

The young musician from Hamburg (currently living in Berlin) moves effortlessly between dance music and classical composition, already producing a sizeable discography in which both the synthetic and organic perfectly coalesce. For him, there is little difference between adding a digital bass line to a house track and writing a score to a classical song with string arrangements. It is therefore unsurprising that after just a few singles August felt he needed to work with a band to evolve as a musician and continue to expand his sound in new directions. At S\u00f3nar we will see the fruits of his labour, where he will be accompanied on stage by his trusted musicians, allowing him to share this particularly creative period, where everything has fallen into place and anything is possible.\r\n\r\nBorn in 1990, August grew up in a very musical environment: his father is a pianist and his mother often played him many of the great works in classical music, both canonical and contemporary. At 5 years old he began to play the piano, at 15 he became interested in electronic dance music and dj\u2019ing, and by 18 he was remixing tracks with considerable ease. A year later at 19, he released his first single on Stil Vor Talent, with the help of Oliver Koletzki.

Dawn Of Midi make contemporary instrumental and minimalist music with acoustic instruments, which sounds like cutting edge and experimental electronica. With this in mind they can perhaps be compared to bands like Elektroguzzi or Brandt Brauer Frick, although the final result is different, closer at times to Plastikman\u2019s first forays into scientific techno or at other times the repetitive depth of Steve Reich. The trio debut in Barcelona for two concerts at S\u00f3nar 2016, one on Thursday 16 at the Auditori, and another on Friday 17 at SonarComplex (S\u00f3nar by Day).\r\n\r\nThe music of Dawn Of Midi is perfectly embodied by the album \"Dysnomia\", released originally in 2013 and recently reissued by Erased Tapes. On this album, the American trio replace improvisation with composition, shaping visceral, physical, complex and open sounds, increasingly influenced by structures and melodies from Morocco, India and Pakistan (the countries where these three instrumentalists can trace their origins). When playing live, their haunting and hypnotic effect is even greater, giving rise to a pure trancelike ceremony where we experience how each musician plays their instrument, far beyond long established conventional forms of music."},

Cook -who recently began a series of parties in Las Vegas, performed on the Great Wall of China and played to 350,000 people in Rio de Janeiro- has perfectly managed the transition from his 90s stardom, reinventing himself without ever losing his identity, which can be defined by his expansive personality, his hilarious sense of humour and an unquestioned ability to lay down sure-fire hits for the dance floor.\r\n\r\nDuring the 80s Cook was bassist for the Housemartins, one of the UK\u2019s most popular groups. Soon after he rapidly took command of the early 90s electronica scene with projects like Beats International and Freak Power, counting on first time hits like \"Dub Be Good To Me \"or\" Turn On, Tune In, Cop Out\", tracks overflowing with groove and built in listener anticipation. The big change came in 1996, when he invented the Fatboy Slim pseudonym, which has now become part of British dance music history. His chunky funky beats and contagious samples defined an era and can be heard almost anywhere in the world. Several of his videos also remain unrivalled, such as the legendary \"Praise You\" shot by Spike Jonze, or Christopher Walken dancing to \"Weapon of Choice\". Long accustomed to performing in front of large crowds, Brighton\u2019s most famous producer knows exactly how to transform any situation and moment into a party, especially in the hallowed halls of S\u00f3nar."},

Messier utilises transducer microphones to capture these electrical signals, along with two large panels located on stage that allow him to connect any transmitter outputs to inputs, thereby shaping the sounds. The artists interacts through the continuous plugging and unplugging of connections to produce a composition of sound and light in real time, allowing us to listen to and observe powerful energetic material that would otherwise be inaudible and invisible. The end result is an amazing, incredibly physical show, mixing minimal sounds, electric shocks, shadow manipulation and energy converted into noise.\r\n\r\nThis new project confirms Martin Messier as an important artist who has shaped his own unique world through a completely original working process. A composer, sculptor, performer and video artist, the Canadian has interacted with sound using all kinds of material as the basis for his work, with each new piece redefining the concept of concrete music. S\u00f3nar has closely followed his career, having previously hosted several of his most important creations to date including: \"Machine Variation\", a large sculpture of pulleys, belts and levers created with Nicolas Bernier; \"The Sewing Machine Orchestra\" an installation producing sounds and compositions from several sewing machines; and \"La Chambre des Machines\" the precursor to the \"Machine Variation\" project -created with Barnier- which also paid tribute to the Intonarumori (noise machines) of futuristic Italian artist Luigi Russolo."},

A few years later he won a competition organized by the Future Classic label, with whom he signed his first contract in 2011. His debut song, \"Sleepless\" was released that same year achieving huge success in Australia. Soon after in November 2012 he released his comprehensive and eponymous album that was equally well received in the United States.

Unquestionably one of the most important producers on the international scene over the last decade, the British artist will demonstrate why he is also regarded as an exceptional dj. The secrets to the success of his dj sets is evident: his extraordinary knowledge of the history of music, his extremely discerning taste in selecting a treasure trove of tracks and his ability to effortlessly mix them together. Four Tet is interested in virtually any genre: techno, ambient, rock, jazz, house, funk, kraut, new wave, afro, hip-hop and bass music in all their guises and from any era. That said the Englishman carefully chooses only the very best from each genre, often tracks by lesser-known artists, thereby building his own alternative to the official mainstream history of music. This makes him the ideal choice to play an extended dj set at this year\u2019s SonarCar on Friday at S\u00f3nar by Night.\r\n\r\nKieran Hebden is so much more than a dj and producer. His skillset and panoramic view of music have regularly enabled him to move sinuously between genres, making him a very special artist who is respected and admired by the public, press and peers alike. His first musical excursions saw him explore pastoral synthetic folk, make incursions into more experimental territor, all the while with a focus on creating glowing synthetic melodies. In recent years his output has skewed towards the dancefloor, reflecting a greater affection for dance tracks and club music. Some highlights from his varied career include: actively collaborating with jazz drummer Steve Reid, before his death; collaborating in the studio with Burial and Thom Yorke; heading post rock band, Fridge; dj\u2019ing with regular cohorts Daphni and Floating Points; remixing a whole host of well known artists; releasing material under the Percussions alias; and running the Text Records label. He is without a doubt a total artist: taking on a host of projects and roles at the same time, and, more importantly doing them all amazingly. We\u2019re thrilled to have him kick off this new and exciting format at SonarCar."},

Although Powell leans more towards industrial sounds and primitive techno, while Senni draws from 90s trance as his main source of inspiration, both the British and Italian artists share a similar working method; deconstructing dance music patterns and structures, while maintaining basic elements to create new genre adaptations. Their alliance is therefore both logical and exciting, with the potential to open up new possibilities forfor experimental club music today. Pay great attention to what this partnership offers on Friday night at SonarLab.\r\n\r\nOscar Powell has revolutionized the British underground scene -and by extension, the international electronic scene- with his powerful productions and his manifesto for Diagonal, the label he runs with Jamie Williams. Powell has instigated a radical and inflammatory sound with his own music and also through the output of label artists including Prostitutes, Shit & Shine and the mighty Russell Haswell.

Their compositions often begin with Cuming; an expressive and charismatic singer whose harsh vocal style aptly represents the group\u2019s name. Meanwhile Wiedermann -one half of the fantastic me- produces delicate rhythmic and melodic structures, resulting in a magical surround sound similar to artists like Kiasmos, Tourist, Bob Moses or Junior Boys.

Under the Howling moniker, the two have found the perfect outlet for their respective talents, and since their very first release entitled, \"Howling\" -while still using their own names- the duo immediately earned the support of an expectant public by delivering their beautiful compositions.

The record -previously rumoured to be titled Radio Silence (the title of the opening track)- features two very special guest collaborators: Frank Ocean and Bon Iver's Justin Vernon. More high profile collaborations come in the form of infamous US producer Rick Rubin -who produced several tracks on the record- and Roald Dahl illustrator Sir Quentin Blake, who designed the artwork. Blake will perform his new songs at S\u00f3nar By Night live, an area in which the London musician feels especially at home, and where his stunning music becomes even more powerful.\u00a0\r\n\r\nArtists like Blake are a rare occurrence. At just 22 years old he released the visionary and era defining EP \"CMYK\", and at 23 his first album, \"James Blake\", earned unanimous praise and proved a worldwide success. His first two albums revealed the building blocks and constants of his sound, namely; crisp production, mastery of bass frequencies, the combination of organic and digital elements, his natural talent on the piano and his mesmerising vocals. These attributes were amply demonstrated on his second - for some, even better - album \"Overgrown\", which deservedly won the Mercury Music Prize and led to a Grammy Nomination for Best New Artist. With his star fixed, Blake has recently been sharing new material in anticipation of his new album, both online and as part of his concerts. For example: a version of \"The Sound of Silence\" by Simon and Garfunkel, a BBC Radio1 residency, and a live broadcast where he played part of a song from his new album (its title track) mixed with a Bill Withers cover version."},

Charismatic, visceral and very talented, Rhodes says Bach (and specifically \"The Goldberg Variations\") saved his life, and he is not exaggerating.

Another of his great contributions to electronic music has been his visionary live shows, always imagined as sensory and technological experiences of colossal proportions, designed on city scale. Up to one million people attended shows in Paris and Houston and Jarre also performed in front of Guinness-World Breaking audience of 3.5 million live in Moscow. It can be said that over 30 years ago, Jarre was the first to invent and create the multimedia concert experience as we know it today, mapping buildings of cities around the world before anyone, lighting the skies with beams and pyrotechnics, offering his audience the ultimate, total immersion, sound and vision experience, which today is the ambition of every international festival."},

Increasingly free from the chains of traditional structure and pre-established patterns, his new songs are more modern and visceral than ever without losing any of his long established musical identity. Grant is like Benjamin Button: the more the years pass by, the younger he appears to be.\r\n\r\nThis state of lucidity and understanding is not achieved overnight. Grant headed indie rock band The Czars for 10 years, where he amply demonstrated his compositional skills. After the group disbanded Grant took a few years to rest and reflect before finally releasing his solo debut, \"Queen of Denmark\" in 2010, a powerful album exposing his demons (his sexual orientation, for example) and addictions (alcohol, drugs). His second album followed (\"Pale Green Ghosts\"), along with a new life in Iceland, awards and recognition from both the broadsheet press and the music industry. He collaborated with the BBC Philharmonic Orchestra as well as Hercules and Love Affair (where he began to show his adventurous side as a solo artist) and very personal covers of Elton John and Lee Hazlewood (the latter alongside Alison Goldfrapp), featuring on both their respective albums."},

K\u00f6lsch will demonstrate each of these facets in a new semi exclusive, visually enhanced live show at SonarPub, one of his rare performances this summer."},

The musician from Limpopo will present tracks from \"Nozinja Lodge\" his debut album on Warp, released in 2015. His signing to the infamous UK label (home to Autechre and Boards Of Canada, among many others) demonstrates the enormous interest his rhythms have aroused in the Western world. However his international standing goes beyond just Warp: last year he recorded the 12\u201d \"Thinking Of You\" with Micachu, Mumdance and Tirza, which was released on The Vinyl Factory, and had Wire magazine devoting pages of extensive reviews.

Fascinated by the strange, jerky street party dance music in the suburbs of Johannesburg, Nozinja infused his own electronic polyrhythms to an already ecstatic and explosive sound that mixed kwaito house and tsonga disco. The movement in its infancy was documented by a variety of cassettes, DVDs and CD-Rs edited by Nozinja Productions, the label created by Mthetwa. Shortly after, artists like Caribou, Ben UFO and Pearson Sound began to incorporate several of these tracks into their dj sets, with British label Honest Jons chiefly responsible for spreading the virus throughout Europe via two essential compilations: \"Shangaan Electro: New Wave Dance Music From South Africa\" and \"Shangaan Shake\", the latter featuring remixes from Theo Parrish, Rashad & Spinn, Hype Williams and Actress, among others."},

And as if that were not enough, he will also form part of the Anohni project, along with Antony Hegarty and Hudson Mohawke, whose performance together at S\u00f3nar by Night will most definitely be one of this year\u2019s highlights. As is typical of his music, \"Garden of Delete\" provides seemingly impossible sounds: new age passages, convoluted digital processes, his own black metal and grunge riffs (he recently toured with Soundgarden and Nine Inch Nails), r&b beats, noise bursts and delicate string chords. Lopatin, who has recently recorded a full album with Teklife's DJ Earl, will touch down at S\u00f3nar armed with a multimedia show created by visual artist Nate Boyce.\r\n\r\nThe son of Russian immigrants, Lopatin started Oneohtrix Point Never in order to explore the sounds of his childhood and adolescence, moving into the realm of digital creation and visionary electronica. Among his arsenal of instruments, perhaps the most important is his father\u2019s antiquated synthesizer, which he has used in most of his works in tandem with his boundless imagination. Although he had already recorded a handful of albums between 2007 and 2009 (partially represented by the compilation \"Rifts\"), his music began to receive recognition after \"Returnal\", released in 2010 by Editions Mego, and later through two fundamental pieces of contemporary electronica; \"Replica\" (released on his own label, Software Records in 2011) and \"R Plus Seven\" on Warp. \"Garden of Delete\" adds yet another notch to a discography that is undoubtedly one of the most original corpuses of expansive and stimulating works in recent years."},

The quality of their work and the essence of their music is perfectly defined by the quartet of EPs released last year: \"Pil Sagol\" on Hivern (John Talabot\u2019s label); \"Shem Vol.1\" and \"Shem Vol. 2\" on I'm A Clich\u00e9, and \"Waiting For a Surprise\" on Multi Culti, to which we should also add their single on Crosstown Rebels remixed by Isol\u00e9e. The dominant genre in their work is house; an oblique, magnetic, unconventional often slow bpm house that loses none of its dance floor effectiveness, infused by string arrangements, Brazilian voices, dry percussion, psychedelic synths and other irresistible hooks that impressively enrich every track.\r\n\r\nPart of the bustling Tel Aviv scene for many years, Red Axes is comprised of Dori Sadovnik and Niv Arzi. They formed in 2010 after the disbanding of rock group Red Cotton in which both played. No doubt their history as musicians has greatly influenced their productions by bringing stylistic variety to their music. This is certainly the case for their excellent (and to date, only) album \"Ballad of The Ice\", a perfect combination of dance and psychedelic music, expressed through a global vision and short, almost pop like, track lengths. Also worthy of note are their energetic and natural live shows that shy away from the clich\u00e9s of rock guitars, focusing fully on house beats. Hyperactive and nocturnal, the duo is currently in a particularly creative purple patch, with a plethora of new music planned for release during the first half of 2016.

Two perfect examples already in circulation as early singles are: the vibrant \"Can\u2019t Get Enough Of Myself\", characteristically flawless pop drawing from funk, hip-hop and reggae; and \"Who Be Lovin Me\", a magnetic mid tempo trap which sees her collaborate with ILoveMakonnen on the mic, and whose video included appearances from A-Trak, De La Soul, DJ Mustard and Earl Sweatshirt, among others. On \"99\u00a2\" the Philadelphia artist critically but humorously reflects on the obsession with perfection and the commercial nature of our lives, discernible from the title and the cover art by Japanese photographer Haruhiko Kawaguchi.

The album, chosen by Resident Advisor as the most important compilation of 2015, reveals the wondrous sound of Terada: American-inspired house music with simple warmth, irresistible melodies, arpeggios and arrangements rooted in the Japanese tradition (close to those of Yellow Magic Orchestra, for example), and an emotional facet rare for dance music.\r\n\r\nTerada's career spans almost 30 years, from the late 80s to the present day, with his first official release coming in 1988. Although connoisseurs of global electronica and house music have revered his excellent albums and his work as head of Far East Recordings for a long time, there are many people who have probably heard his music without even realising it. For instance, he created the soundtrack for seven iterations of the famous Playstation video game \"Ape Escape\" launched in 1999. More recently Terada featured on \"Sounds From The Far East\" (compiled by DJ and Dutch producer Hunee), helping him open the gates to Europe and S\u00f3nar by Night, where for the first time we can enjoy live, his elegant, sensitive and captivating disco-garage-house."},

In just one year and with a handful of releases to his name, he was voted the best grime and male artist at the most recent Mobo Awards, with his name included \u2013along with Lewisham MC Novelist- in the latest prestigious BBC \"Sound Of\" list, a survey among critics and specialists conducted annually by the BBC to choose the best new UK artists.\r\n\r\nStormzy\u2019s lyrical flow is strongly reminiscent of that of Dizzee Rascal (with whom he has collaborated in the past), and his imaginative productions demonstrate his ability to escape the typical clich\u00e9s of the genre. In fact Stormzy has proved that his sound is beyond grime, and easily translates to more thoughtful hip-hop and r&b, probably thanks to the influence of one of his favourite artists, Frank Ocean. The Londoner\u2019s talent and artistic ambition is clearly audible on records like the mini LP \"Dreamers Disease\", his latest single \"WickedSkengman 4\" and his big hit, \"Know Me From\". It can also be heard on two significant recent projects: taking many by surprise with his remix for Nick Jonas, (Jonas Brothers); and via his recent trip to Ghana where he collaborated with local artists, a trip documented by the BBC radio station 1Xtra. His live show at S\u00f3nar will surely confirm that this new MC (scarcely 22 years old) is destined to go far."},

He began releasing albums in the early 2000s on Foehn Records, when his sound was more akin to the pastoral folk of Boards of Canada or Morr Music's electronic indie pop. For a time he was also linked to another leading national electronic label, spa.RK. He has experimented with African and oriental sounds, never losing sight of the hip-hop beats that provide the framework for all of his productions. He has released material on a variety of labels such as Galleta, City Centre Offices, Lovemonk and Lowriders, and has collaborated with renowned American writer Barry Gifford on a multimedia project.

The compositions of Christos and Fotis Papadakis are both emotive and movement inducing, even though they are written and structured with disparate elements that refuse to fall into obvious patterns. They consist of palpitating beats, imaginative textures, seductive melodies and sporadic bursts of treated vocals. At times reminiscent of a resplendent Bonobo, or the galloping house of Four Tet at his best, and then invoking the cosmic jazz-funk of Flying Lotus. Their live performance includes drum machines, synths and various keyboards, and will open Saturday day at SonarVillage.\r\n\r\nChristos and Fotis have spent a lifetime playing music together, creating sounds and tinkering with instruments in their native Thessaloniki. Some of their earliest joint experiments were included on their first compilation, \u201cSlow Years\u201d, released in 2012. Three more records followed: a four song 12\u201d released on Project Mooncircle; a self-released EP entitled \u201cAccept Failure As Part Of The Process\u201d on which experimental pieces were inspired by their favourite artists (including William S.

In fact, she began making music under various monikers in her native Kentucky before moving to Chicago, and has continued to produce under her current artist name with hits like \"Exodus\", \"We Do not Need No Music (Thank You Rahaan)\" and \"Stay\", magnetic, contemporary yet classically styled house tracks.

Right now they are among the few DJs in the world capable of balancing the essence of the underground with an accessibility that attracts all types of audiences.\r\n\r\nThe Martinez brothers have achieved this rare prominence after many years of hard work.

Listening to his material it is easy to understand why: TroyBoi has an inimitable talent for hitting all the right notes, with adrenaline-laced bangers that work equally well in small clubs as large-scale festivals. His talent and progression is clearly demonstrated by the track \"Soundclash\", together with Flosstradamus in early 2015.\r\n\r\nAlthough typically associated with the trap genre, Troyboi\u2019s sound moves beyond the confines of simplistic categorizations. In some of his tracks you will be able to hear original funk elements akin to Kaytranada (e.g. in \"Do You?\"); in others he plays with irresistible percussive drumbeats reminiscent of Hud Mo or Lunice, as well as including samples from Asian folklore; while some of his more recent hits have achieved huge success and openly appeal to larger and more commercial audiences, following in the footsteps of artists like Diplo. In fact, Diplo recently contacted him to collaborate on one of his latest successful songs, \"Afterhours\", which also featured Nina Sky. In just one year, Troyboi has also remixed Jack \u00dc (the Mad Decent heads' collaboration with Skrillex), and has worked with several other leading names from the international scene, including Timbaland and DJ Craze among others.
